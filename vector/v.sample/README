This is s.sample, version 0.6B <02 Jan 1995>
Copyright (C) 1994, 1995. James Darrell McCauley

The man page should have installed automagically. Please check.
Don't forget to run your MAKELINKS script.

A tutorial is available in s.sample-tutorial.ps.gz, a compressed
PostScript file. A LaTeX version is in s.sample-tutorial.tex.
No other formats are available.

The subdirectory validation/ contains some sample data and output.

This is Beta software - so please be sure to keep in touch
with me if you have problems. I've only been able to do limited
testing. Regarding lat-long data, I'm not sure if this will work
correctly. The way it was written, we're doing interpolation
over data in a plane (see figure 1 in the tutorial). If this
changes from a plane to a curved surface, I'm not sure what
happens.
