<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.bridge</em> finds bridges and articulation points in a network.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
Bridge in a network is an edge/line whose removal would disconnect 
the (sub-)network. A node is an articulation point if its removal 
would disconnect the (sub-)network. For more information and formal 
definitions check the wikipedia entries:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_%28graph_theory%29">bridge</a> 
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_vertex">articulation 
point</a>.
<p>
The output of the module contains the selected 
features. For <b>method=bridge</b>, lines corresponding to 
bridges are copied from the input map to the output map. On the 
other hand, for <b>method=articulation</b>, points are created on 
the positions of articulation points.
<p>

<br>In GRASS GIS, <em>line</em> is not always a single line 
segment. It might be, and often is, a sequence of line segments 
between two intersections. Also, articulation point is a standard 
graph theoretic terminology which is slightly misleading in GRASS. 
An articulation point in graph theory is an articulation
<em>node</em> in GRASS terminology.
