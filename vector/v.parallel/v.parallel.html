<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.parallel</em> creates parallel lines to the input vector lines which
can be used as half-buffers.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
Usage of <b>-b</b> flag will overrule the <b>side</b> parameter.

<h2>KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
There is a problem with side-offset parallel line generation for inside corners.
To avoid this problem, the <b>-b</b> flag might be used.
<!-- in Vect_line_parallel(), v.segment is also affected -->
