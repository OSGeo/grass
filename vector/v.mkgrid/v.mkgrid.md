## DESCRIPTION

*v.mkgrid* creates a vector map representation of a regular coordinate
grid. Point, line, and area vector grids can be created.

## NOTES

Grid points created with the **type=point** option will be placed at the
*center* of each grid cell, like centroids with the default
**type=area** option.

Grid lines created with the **type=line** option will be identical to
the edges of each grid cell, like boundaries with the default
**type=area** option.

The resultant grid can be rotated around the origin (center of the grid)
with the **angle** option.

Optionally hexagons can be created with the **-h** flag. Hexagons are by
default symmetric. Asymmetric hexagons can be allowed with the **-a**
flag.

This module is NOT to be used to generate a vector map of USGS
quadrangles, because USGS quads are not exact rectangles.

## EXAMPLES

### Creating a global grid in a latitude-longitude

To be run in a latitude-longitude project (WGS84)

```sh
# set the region:
g.region n=90 s=-90 w=-180 e=180 res=10 -p
projection: 3 (Latitude-Longitude)
zone:       0
datum:      wgs84
ellipsoid:  wgs84
north:      90N
south:      90S
west:       180W
east:       180E
nsres:      10
ewres:      10
rows:       18
cols:       36
cells:      648

# create 10 degree size grid:
v.mkgrid map=grid_10deg

# create 20 degree size grid:
v.mkgrid map=grid_20deg box=20,20
```

### Creating a grid in a metric projection

Creating a 4x3 grid, cells 20km a side, with lower left corner at
2716500,6447000:

```sh
v.mkgrid map=coro_grid grid=4,3 position=coor coordinates=2716500,6447000 box=20000,20000
```

### Creating a positioned grid in a latitude-longitude

Creating a 10x12 lat/lon grid, cells 2 arc-min a side, with lower left
corner at 167deg 52min east, 47deg 6min south. For use with e.g. QGIS
you can then pull this grid into a project with projected coordinate
reference system (CRS) using *v.proj* before exporting as a vector file
with *v.out.ogr* (within GRASS GIS you could just use *d.grid -w* from
the project with projected CRS for the same effect):

```sh
v.mkgrid map=p2min_grid grid=10,12 position=coor coordinates=167:52E,47:06S box=0:02,0:02
```

### Creating a simple point pattern

North Carolina sample dataset example, creating a 1km spaced point grid
based on the current region extent defined by the "elevation" map:

```sh
g.region raster=elevation res=1000 -pa
v.mkgrid type=point map=pointpattern
```

### Creating a regular point pattern

North Carolina sample dataset example, creating a regular spaced point
grid based on the current region extent defined by the "elevation" map,
using a two-step approach:

```sh
# create first set of points, covering extent of "elevation" raster map
g.region raster=elevation res=1000 -pa
v.mkgrid type=point map=pointpattern1

# shift grid by half point distance (map units)
g.region n=n+500 w=w+500 e=e+500 s=s+500 -p

# create second set of points
v.mkgrid type=point map=pointpattern2

# merge into final point pattern
v.patch input=pointpattern1,pointpattern2 output=pointpattern3
```

### Creating hexagons in a metric projection

North Carolina sample dataset example, creating regular hexagons based
on the current region extent defined by the "elevation" map and raster
resolution for the hexagon size:

```sh
g.region raster=elevation res=5000 -pa
v.mkgrid map=hexagons -h

d.grid 5000
```

### Using hexagons for point density

To compute point density in a hexagonal grid for the vector map
*points_of_interest* in the basic North Carolina sample dataset, the
vector map itself is used to set extent of the computational region. The
resolution is based on the desired size of hexagons.

```sh
g.region vector=points_of_interest res=2000 -pa
```

The hexagonal grid is created as a vector map based on the previously
selected extent and size of the grid.

```sh
v.mkgrid map=hexagons -h
```

The following counts the number of points per hexagon using the
*[v.vect.stats](v.vect.stats.md)* module.

```sh
v.vect.stats points=points_of_interest areas=hexagons count_column=count
```

Users should note that some of the points may be outside the grid since
the hexagons cannot cover all the area around the edges (the
computational region extent needs to be enlarged if all points should be
considered). The last command sets the vector map color table to
`viridis` based on the `count` column.

```sh
v.colors map=hexagons use=attr column=count color=viridis
```
