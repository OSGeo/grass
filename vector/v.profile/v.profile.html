<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.profile</em> prints out distance and attributes of points/lines
along a profiling line. Distance is calculated from the first profiling line
coordinate pair or from the beginning of vector line.<br>
The <em>buffer</em> (tolerance) parameter sets how far point can be
located from a profiling line and still be included in the output data set.<br>
The <em>output</em> map option can be used to visually check which points are
profiled. The <em>buffer</em> (tolerance) setting does not affect lines.
Lines are sampled at their crossing point with profiling line.
<p>
By default Z values are printed if input vector is a 3D map. It can be
disabled with the <b>-z</b> flag.<br>
The profiling line can be provided as N,E coordinate pairs or from an
input vector map. As a profiling line must be a single line, the user
should use the <em>profile_where</em> parameter to select a single line
from a profile input map if it contains multiple vector features.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
Currently the module can profile only points and lines (including 3D ones).
Areas and other complex features are not supported. If in future users can
provide reasonable examples how area sampling should work and why it is
important, area (or any other feature type) sampling can be added.
</p>
<p>
Due to bugs in GRASS native buffering algorithms, this module for now
depends on GEOS and will not function if GRASS is compiled without GEOS.
This restriction will be removed as soon as GRASS native buffer generation
is fixed.
</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

List all geonames along part of road NC-96 (NC Basic dataset).
The output will be stored in a file for later usage.
We will use comma as delimiter and three numbers after decimal
separator for distance. Output file will contain data for all points,
that are within 500 m range to profiling line.

<div class="code"><pre>
v.profile input=geonames@PERMANENT output=/home/user/NC_96_geonames.csv\

<p>
Create river valley crossection and provide river marker (Spearfish dataset):

<div class="code"><pre>
# Take elevation samples
r.profile input=elevation.dem@PERMANENT output=/home/user/elevation.profile \
  profile=600570.27364,4920613.41838,600348.034348,4920840.38617

# Now get distance to place where river marker should be set
v.profile input=streams@PERMANENT output=/home/user/river_profile.csv \
  east_north=600570.27364,4920613.41838,600348.034348,4920840.38617
</pre></div>

<h2>BUGS</h2>

Strings are enclosed in double quotes ", still quotes within string are
not escaped.
<p>
Output does not contain Vector CAT values. Only way how to get CAT value is from
the attribute table.
<p>
If sampled feature (point, line) contains multiple attribute entries
(has multiple CAT values), only the first one is reported. If this is a
limitation in some practical use case, a feature request in GRASS GIS
issue tracker should be opened.
