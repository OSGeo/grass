<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.outlier</em> removes outlier points. By default, the outlier
identification is done by a bicubic spline interpolation of the
observation with a high regularization parameter and a low resolution
in south-north and east-west directions. Those points that differ in
an absolute value more than the given threshold from a fixed value,
reckoned from its surroundings by the interpolation, are considered as
an outlier, and hence are removed.

There is a flag to create a vector that can be visualizated by
qgis. That means that topology is build and the z coordinate is
considered as a category.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h4>Basic outlier removal</h4>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.outlier input=vector_map output=vector_output outlier=vector_outlier thres_O=25
</pre></div>

In this case, a basic outlier removal is done with a threshold of 25 m.

<h4>Basic outlier removal</h4>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.outlier -q input=vector_map output=vector_output outlier=vector_outlier qgis=vector_qgis
</pre></div>

Now, the outlier removal uses the default threshold and there is also
an output vector available for visualizaton in QGIS
 (<a href="http://www.qgis.org">http://www.qgis.org</a>).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

This module is designed to work with LIDAR data, so not topology is
built but in the QGIS output.
