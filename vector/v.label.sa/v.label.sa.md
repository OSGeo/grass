## DESCRIPTION

*v.label.sa* makes a label-file from a GRASS vector map with labels
created from attributes in the attached table. The labels are placed in
as optimal place as possible. The label file has the same syntax as the
one created by [v.label](v.label.md)

## EXAMPLE

North Carolina example:

```sh
# get font names:
d.font -L

v.label.sa roadsmajor labels=roads_labels column=ROAD_NAME color=red \
           background=white size=250 font=Vera

# set region:
g.region raster=lsat7_2002_10 -p

# display:
d.rgb b=lsat7_2002_10 g=lsat7_2002_20 r=lsat7_2002_30
d.vect roadsmajor col=yellow
d.labels roads_labels
```
