<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.digit</em> is a vector map digitizer with graphical user interface.
Attribute tables can be directly generated while digitizing (define in
"Settings" first).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The <b>bgcmd</b> option is intended to be used with display (d.*) commands.
If several display commands are to be used to render the background
they should be separated with the semi-colon ';' character.
When run from the command line, these display commands will generally
need to be "quoted" as they will contain spaces (see examples).
<P>
<b>Dead (deleted) lines</b>: If a user deletes a line in <em>v.digit</em>,
it is internally only marked in the geometry file as 'dead' but it remains
there and occupies space. Any vector module used afterwards on this map
which really reads and writes vector geometry (so not <em>g.copy</em>) will
writes only lines which are 'alive'.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h4>Start a monitor and display a raster to help setup and zoom to area of interest</h4>
<div class="code"><pre>
d.mon x0
d.rast name_of_raster
</pre></div>

<p>

<h4>Digitizing an area based on a existing raster map; creating a new vector map</h4>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.digit -n map=name_of_new_vector_map bgcmd="d.rast map=name_of_raster"
</pre></div>
<p>
The "<b>-n</b>" flag specifies that your vector map does not yet exist and
thus will be created with the name given by "<b>map=</b>". "<b>bgcmd=</b>"
specifies a display (d.*) command and is set in "quotes" as it contains a space.
<p>
The <em>v.digit</em> GUI appears -- after exiting <em>v.digit</em> GUI the 
vector map "name_of_new_vector_map" is created.
<P>
After leaving <em>v.digit</em>, run:
<div class="code"><pre>
d.erase
d.vect "name_of_new_vector_map" 
</pre></div>
The display should be cleared and the newly created vector should appear in 
the monitor.
<p>

<h4>Digitizing a second vector, using your first vector and the raster image
as background</h4>
<p>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.digit -n map=name_of_second_vector \
bgcmd="d.rast map=name_of_your_raster; d.vect map=name_of_new_vector_map"
</pre></div>
<p>
The <em>v.digit</em> GUI appears and the layers defined with <b>bgcmd</b>
are displayed in the background. As the <b>bgcmd</b> commands are executed 
as a series of commands (separated by a ";"), the last command (d.vect)
displays over the top of the earlier raster image.<br>
<p>

<h4> Combining <b>bgcmd</b> with <em>d.save</em> to use the existing
display as a backdrop</h4>
<P>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.digit map=name bgcmd="`d.save -o | cut -f1 -d'#' | tr '\n' ';'`"
</pre></div>

<a href="d.save.html"><em>d.save</em></a> will list the commands used to draw
the current display; <em>cut</em> and <em>tr</em> are UNIX commands which are
used to remove comments and trade newlines for semi-colons, respectively.
