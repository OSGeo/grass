<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.components</em> computes the weakly and strongly connected 
components in a network.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
Two nodes, <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> are in the same strongly 
connected component if there are directed paths from <em>u</em> to 
<em>v</em> and from <em>v</em> to <em>u</em>. The nodes are in the 
same weakly connected component if, ignoring orientation of the 
edges, there is a path between them.
<br>

The type of components is specified by <b>method</b> parameter. 
<em>v.net.components</em> creates a table and links it to the given <b>layer</b>.
This table contains only two integer columns: <em>cat</em> and <em>comp
</em>. If a point or both endpoints of a line belong to the same 
component then the point/line is written to the output map and 
appropriate information is stored in the table. If <b>-a</b> flag is 
set then new points are added on the nodes without points. These 
points have category numbers larger than any category used in the 
input map.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Any road network should form a single strongly connected component. 
Otherwise, it is impossible to travel between some places.
