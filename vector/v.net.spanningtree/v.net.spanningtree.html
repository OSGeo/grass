<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.spanningtree</em> finds the minimum spanning tree in a 
network. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>
A spanning tree is a minimum cost subnetwork connecting all nodes in a 
network. Or, if a network is disconnected then the module computes 
the minimum spanning tree for each (weakly) connected component. So, 
strictly speaking, <em>v.net.spanningtree</em> does not compute spanning tree
but a spanning forest. As the name suggests, a spanning tree is a tree. That 
is, it contains no cycles and if a component has N nodes then the 
tree has N-1 edges connecting all nodes. <b>Accol</b> is used to 
specify the costs of the edges. The <b>output</b> consists of the 
edges in the spanning tree.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Find cheapest set of pipelines connecting all nodes.
