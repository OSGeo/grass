<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.allpairs</em> computes the shortest path between each select 
node and all other nodes. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>

An attribute table is created and linked to <b>layer</b>. The table 
contains three columns: <em>cat</em>, <em>to_cat</em>, <em>cost</em>. 
Each entry denotes the cost of the shortest path from <em>cat</em> to 
<em>to_cat</em>. If the cost is negative then no path exists. If points 
are specified by <b>cats, layer</b> or <b>where</b> parameters then the 
table is filled only for the selected points. In other words, <em>cat</em> 
columns contains only selected points but the distances are computed and 
updated for <em>all</em> other nodes.<br>
If flag <b>-a</b> is set then new points are added on nodes without points. 
These points have the largest category. Precisely, the category of each new 
point is larger than any of the old categories. If the flag is not set 
then no new points are created and hence the attribute table stores the 
costs only between the points already present in the input. Output consists 
of all points mentioned in either of the columns.<br>
If <b>abcolumn</b> is not given then then the same costs are used for 
forward and backward arcs.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Find shortest path along roads from selected archsites (Spearfish sample 
dataset):
<div class="code"><pre>
# prepare network: connect archsites to roads with threshold 200
v.net input=roads@PERMANENT points=archsites@PERMANENT \
output=roads_net operation=connect thresh=200

# verify result
v.category input=roads_net option=report

# only lines should have a category in layer 1
# only points should have a category in layer 2

# shortest path between all points with categories 1 - 5 in layer 2
v.net.allpairs input=roads_net cats=1-5 out=roads_net_all
v.db.select roads_net_all
</pre></div>

Result in matrix form:
<div class="code"><pre>
from\to	1		3		4		5
1	0		18820.386	17206.651	17373.274
3	18820.386	0		1739.079	9040.575
4	17206.651	1739.079	0		7426.84
5	17373.274	9040.575	7426.84		0
</pre></div>
