<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<em>v.surf.bspline</em> performs a bilinear/bicubic spline interpolation with
Tykhonov regularization. The input is a 2D or 3D vector points map. Values to
interpolate can be the z values of 3D points or the values in a user-specified
attribue column in a 2D or 3D map. Output can be a raster or vector map.
Optionally, a "sparse point" vector map can be input which indicates the
location of <b><i>output</i></b> vector points.
<p>From a theoretical perspective, the interpolating procedure takes place in two
parts: the first is an estimate of the linear coefficients of a spline function
is derived from the observation points using a least squares regression; the
second is the computation of the interpolated surface (or interpolated vector
points). As used here, the splines are 2D piece-wise non-zero polynomial
functions calculated within a limited, 2D area. The length of each spline step
is defined by <b><i>sie</i></b> for the east-west direction and
<b><i>sin</i></b> for the north-south direction. For optimum performance, the
length of spline step should be no less than the distance between observation
points. Each vector point observation is modeled as a linear function of the
non-zero splines in the area around the observation. The least squares
regression predicts the the coefficients of these linear functions.
Regularization, avoids the need to have one one observation and one coefficient
for each spline (in order to avoid instability). 

<p>With regularly distributed data points, a spline step corresponding to the
maximum distance between two points in both the east and north directions is
sufficient. But often data points are not regularly distributed and require
statistial regularization or estimation. In such cases, v.surf.bspline will
attempt to minimize the gradient of bilinear splines or the curvature of bicubic
splines in areas lacking point observations. As a general rule, spline step
length should be greater than the mean distance between observation points
(twice the distance between points is a good starting point). Separate east-west
and north-south spline step length arguments allows the user to account for some
degree of anisotropy in the distribution of observation points. Short spline
step lengths--especially spline step lengths that are less than the distance
between observation points--can greatly increase processing time.

<p>Moreover, the maximum number of splines for each direction at each time is
fixed, regardless of the spline step length. As the total number of splines used
increases (i.e., with small spline step lengths), the region is automatically split
into subregions for interpolation. Each subregion can contain no more than
150x150 splines. To avoid subregion boundary problems, subregions are created to
partially overlap each other. A weighted mean of observations, based on point
locations, is calculated within each subregion. 

<p>The Tykhonov regularization parameter ("<b><i>lambda_i</i></b>") acts to smooth
the interpolation. With a small <b><i>lambda_i</i></b>, the interpolated surface
closely follows observation points; a larger value will produce a smoother
interpolation.

<p>The input can be a 2D pr 3D vector points map. If "<b><i>layer =</i></b>" 0 the
z-value of a 3D map is used for interpolation. If layer &gt; 0, the user must
specify an attribute column to used for interpolation using the
"<b><i>column=</i></b>" argument (2D or 3D map). 

<p>v.surf.bspline can produce a raster OR a vector output (NOT simultaneously).

<p>If output is a vector points map and a "<b><i>sparse=</i></b>" vector points map
is not specified, the output vector map will contain points at the same
locations as observation points in the input map, but the values of the output
points are interpolated values. If instead a "<b><i>sparse=</i></b>" vector points
map is specified, the output vector map will contain points at the same locations as
the sparse vector map points, and values will be those of the interpolated
raster surface at those points.

<p>A cross validation "leave-one-out" analysis is available to help to determine
the optimal <b><i>lambda_i</i></b> value that produces an interpolation that
best fits the original observation data. The more points used for
cross-validation, the longer the time needed for computation. Empirical testing
indicates a threshold of a maximum of 100 points is recommended. Note that cross
validation can run very slowly if more than 100 observations are used. The
cross-validation output reports <i>mean</i> and <i>rms</i> of the residuals from
the true point value and the estimated from the interpolation for a fixed series
of <b><i>lambda_i</i></b> values. No vector nor raster output will be created
when cross-validation is selected. 


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Basic interpolation</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.bspline input=point_vector output=interpolate_surface method=bicubic
</pre></div>

A bicubic spline interpolation will be done and a vector points map with estimated
(i.e., interpolated) values will be created. 

<h3>Basic interpolation and raster output with a longer spline step</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.bspline input=point_vector raster=interpolate_surface sie=25 sin=25
</pre></div>

A bilinear spline interpolation will be done with a spline step length of 25 map
units. An interpolated raster map will be created at the current region resolution.

<h3>Estimation of <b><i>lambda_i</i></b> parameter with a cross validation proccess</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.bspline -c input=point_vector 
</pre></div>

<h3>Estimation on sparse points</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.bspline input=point_vector sparse=sparse_points output=interpolate_surface
</pre></div>

An output map of vector points will be created, corresponding to the sparse vector map, with interpolated values.

<h3>Using attribute values instead Z-coordinates</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.bspline input=point_vector raster=interpolate_surface layer=1 column=attrib_column
</pre></div>

The interpolation will be done using the values in attrib_column, in the
table associated with layer 1.

<h3>North carolina location example using Z-coordinates for interpolation</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.bspline --o --v input=elev_lid792_bepts@PERMANENT raster=elev_lid792_rast sie=5 sin=5 method=bicubic lambda_i=0.1 -z
</pre></div>


<h2>BUGS</h2>
Known issues:
<p>In order to avoid RAM memory problems, an auxiliary table is needed for
recording some intermediate calculations. This requires the "<b>GROUP BY</b>"
SQL function is used, which is not supported by the "<b>dbf</b>" driver. For
this reason, vector map output "<b><i>output=</i></b>" is not permitted with the
DBF driver. There are no problems with the raster map output from the DBF
driver.
