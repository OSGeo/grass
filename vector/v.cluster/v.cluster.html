<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.cluster</em> partitions a point cloud into clusters or clumps. 

<p>
If the minimum number of points is not specified with the <b>min</b> 
option, the minimum number of points to constitute a cluster is 
<i>number of dimensions + 1</i>, i.e. 3 for 2D points and 4 for 3D 
points.

<p>
If the maximum distance is not specified with the <b>distance</b> 
option, the maximum distance is estimated from the observed distances 
to the neighbors using the upper 99% confidence interval.

<p>
<em>v.cluster</em> supports different methods for clustering. The 
recommended methods are <b>method=dbscan</b> if all clusters should 
have a density (maximum distance between points) not larger than 
<b>distance</b> or <b>method=density</b> if clusters should be created 
separately for each observed density (distance to the farthest neighbor).

<h4>dbscan</h4>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN">Density-Based Spatial 
Clustering of Applications with Noise</a> is a commonly used clustering 
algorithm. A new cluster is started for a point with at least 
<i>min</i> - 1 neighbors within the maximum distance. These neighbors 
are added to the cluster. The cluster is then expanded as long as at 
least <i>min</i> - 1 neighbors are within the maximum distance for each 
point already in the cluster.

<h4>dbscan2</h4>
Similar to <i>dbscan</i>, but here it is sufficient if the resultant 
cluster consists of at least <b>min</b> points, even if no point in the 
cluster has at least <i>min - 1</i> neighbors within <b>distance</b>.

<h4>density</h4>
This method creates clusters according to their point density. The 
maximum distance is not used. Instead, the points are sorted ascending 
by the distance to their farthest neighbor (core distance), inspecting 
<i>min - 1</i> neighbors. The densest cluster is created first, using 
as threshold the core distance of the seed point. The cluster is 
expanded as for DBSCAN, with the difference that each cluster has its 
own maximum distance. This method can identify clusters with different 
densities and can create nested clusters.

<h4>optics</h4>
This method is <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm">Ordering Points to 
Identify the Clustering Structure</a>. It is controlled by the number 
of neighbor points (option <i>min</i> - 1). The core distance of a 
point is the distance to the farthest neighbor. The reachability of a 
point <i>q</i> is its distance from a point <i>p</i> (original optics: 
max(core-distance(p), distance(p, q))). The aim of the <i>optics</i> 
method is to reduce the reachability of each point. Each unprocessed 
point is the seed for a new cluster. Its neighbors are added to a queue 
sorted by smallest reachability if their reachability can be reduced. 
The points in the queue are processed and their unprocessed neighbors 
are added to a queue sorted by smallest reachability if their 
reachability can be reduced.

<p>
The <i>optics</i> method does not create clusters itself, but produces 
an ordered list of the points together with their reachability. The 
output list is ordered according to the order of processing: the first 
point processed is the first in the list, the last point processed is 
the last in the list. Clusters can be extracted from this list by 
identifying valleys in the points' reachability, e.g. by using a 
threshold value. If a maximum distance is specified, this is used to 
identify clusters, otherwise each separated network will constitute a 
cluster.

<p>
The OPTICS algorithm uses each yet unprocessed point to start a new 
cluster. The order of the input points is arbitrary and can thus 
influence the resultant clusters.

<h4>optics2</h4>
<b>EXPERIMENTAL</b> This method is similar to OPTICS, minimizing the 
reachability of each point. Points are reconnected if their 
reachability can be reduced. Contrary to OPTICS, a cluster's seed is 
not fixed but changed if possible. Each point is connected to another 
point until the core of the cluster (seed point) is reached. 
Effectively, the initial seed is updated in the process. Thus separated 
networks of points are created, with each network representing a 
cluster. The maximum distance is not used.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Analysis of random points for areas in areas of the vector 
<i>urbanarea</i> (North Carolina sample dataset).

<p>
First generate 1000 random points within the areas the vector urbanarea
and within the subregion, then do clustering and visualize the result:

<div class="code"><pre>
# pick a subregion of the vector urbanarea
g.region -p n=272950 s=188330 w=574720 e=703090 res=10

# create random points in areas
v.random output=random_points npoints=1000 restrict=urbanarea

# identify clusters
v.cluster input=random_points output=clusters_optics method=optics

# set random vector color table for the clusters
v.colors map=clusters_optics layer=2 use=cat color=random

# display in command line
d.mon wx0

# note the second layer and transparent (none) color of the circle border
d.vect map=clusters_optics layer=2 icon=basic/point size=10 color=none
</pre></div>
