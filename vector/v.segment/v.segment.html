<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.segment</em> generates segments or points from input lines and from
positions read from a text file or '<tt>stdin</tt>'.

<p>The format is:
<div class="code"><pre>
P &lt;point id&gt;   &lt;line cat&gt; &lt;offset&gt; [&lt;side offset&gt;]
L &lt;segment id&gt; &lt;line cat&gt; &lt;start offset&gt; &lt;end offset&gt; [&lt;side offset&gt;]
</pre></div>

The offsets can be percent values of the line length. If the offsets are
negative, they start from the end node of the line. -0 means the end of the
line.

<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>

The user could send to <tt>stdin</tt> something like:
<div class="code"><pre>
P 1 356 24.56
P 2 495 12.31
P 3 500 -12.31
P 4 510 -20%
...
</pre></div>
(pipe or redirect from file into the command).<br>


<h2>NOTES</h2>

A segment is only created for the first line found of the specified category.
<p>Points are generated along the lines at the given distance(s) or percent(s)
of the line length from the beginning or end, if offsets are negative, of the
vector line.
<p>The side offset is the orthogonal distance from the line. Positive side
offsets are to the right side of the line going forward, negative offsets
are to the left (<em>d.vect</em> with <em>display=shape,dir</em> shows
the direction of vector lines). As the segment distance is measured along the
original line, side-offset lines will be longer than the start-end segment distance
for outside corners of curving lines, and shorter for inside corners.
<p>All offsets are measured in map units (see "<em>g.proj -p</em>") or percents
of the line length, if followed by a % character.
<p>To place a point in the middle of a line, 50% offset can be used or the
<em>v.to.db</em> module may be used to find the line's length. Then half of
that distance can be used as the along-line offset.

<h2>BUGS</h2>
There is a problem with side-offset parallel line generation for inside corners.
<!-- in Vect_line_parallel(), v.parallel is also affected -->
