How do you store the 'measure'? PostGIS does not have measure AFAIK.

Neither did I.

Or vice versa, MPs can (must!?) be used to create LRS. In fact I cannot find
how ESRI creates LRS.
What data are you working with? We have for example the layer of roads
(lines) and the layer of mileposts (points). I take these two layer
and make LRS from them.

My objection is, that if the MP (input point) is not near a vertex on the line,
and previous and next segment have different scale, you get an error,
which is not necessary. But well, probably not so important. Example:
---    line
 +     vertex
 x1    milepost with km

+--------------+------+
x0       x1           x2

The distance x0-x1 in GIS = 0.8 km (real world 1km)
The distance x1-x2 in GIS = 1.2 km (real world 1km)
Note that of course the distances measured in GIS differ from those
in real world and may be both longer and shorter

Now we have 3 vertices, the first will have measure 0, the third measure 2.
And the second? Which measure? Optimal would be to add a new vertex where
the MP is:
+--------+-----+------+
x0       x1           x2

No, sorry, I mean a physical changes of mileposts in the real world.
If you cannot maintain partial changes in LRS, the only option
is to change always all mileposts.

I don't have any documentation, as we use it only here. I have to write
something, but I don't have much time, let me know if you are interested.
For now briefly:
All the LRS is stored in one table, each record stores information
about one segment between two mileposts:
 rsid        | integer | id of LRS segment (not so important)
 lcat        | integer | line id, unique id of the line
 lid         | integer | id of 'route' (for example 456 for 'Highway 12')
 start_map   | float8  | the start of segment measured from the beginning of the line
 end_map     | float8  | the start of segment measured from the beginning of the line
 start_mp    | float8  | milepost on the beginning of the segment
 start_off   | float8  | offset on the beginning of the segment
 end_mp      | float8  | milepost on the end of the segment
 end_off     | float8  | offset on the end of the segment

Say the you want to georeference a point specified by route id = 456 and
km+offset = 15+300.
You find a record which has
lid = 456 and start_mp < 15 and start_off < 300 and end_mp > 15 and end_off > 300
now it is possible to calculate the distance from the beginning of the line in GIS.

In fact, I have here also simple web application which works with
this table in Postgres and line layer in PostGIS using a function in Postgres.

Whole part between 3 and 4 must be referenced from 3, but such changes
are not frequent in real world and to change only the part between 3 and 4
is not so difficult (still talking about changes in real world, traffic signs for
example, signs along the river etc.)

I dont know any published, there is certainly one in MGE and I am
almost sure that it is different from ESRI.

I would prefer mails.
