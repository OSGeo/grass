<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.distance</em> finds the nearast element in set <em>to</em> 
for every point in set <em>from</em>. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>

These two sets are given by the respective <b>layer</b>, <b>where</b> 
and <b>cats</b> parameters. The type of <em>to</em> features is specified 
by <b>to_type</b> parameter. All <em>from</em> features are <em>points</em>. 
A table is linked to <b>output</b> map containing various information 
about the relation. More specifically, the table has three columns: 
<em>cat</em>, <em>tcat</em> and <em>dist</em> storing category of each 
<em>from</em> feature, category of the nearest <em>to</em> feature and 
the distance between them respectively. Furthemore, <b>output</b> map 
contains the shorest path between each <em>cat</em>, <em>tcat</em> pair. 
Each path consist of several lines. If a line is on the shorest path 
from a point then the category of this point is assigned to the line. 
Note that every line may contain more than one category value since a
single line may be on the shortest path for more than one <em>from</em> 
feature. And so the shortest paths can be easily obtained by querying 
lines with corresponding category number.
<p>
The costs of arcs in forward and backward direction are specified by 
<b>afcolumn</b> and <b>abcolumn</b> columns respectively. If 
<b>abcolumn</b> is not given, the same cost is used in both directions.  
<p>
<em>v.net.distance</em> will not work if you are trying to find the nearest 
neighbors within a group of nodes, i.e. where <em>to</em> and <em>from</em> 
are the same set of nodes, as the closest node will be the node itself and 
the result will be zero-length paths. In order to find nearest neighbors 
within a group of nodes, you can either loop through each node as <em>to</em> 
and all other nodes as <em>from</em> or create a complete distance matrix with 
<a href="v.net.allpairs.html">v.net.allpairs</a> and select the lowest non-zero 
distance for each node.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
Find shortest path and distance from every school to the nearest hospital 
and show all paths.

<p>
Streets are grey lines, schools are green circles, hospitals are red 
crosses, shortest paths are blue lines:
