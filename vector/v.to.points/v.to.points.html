<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.to.points</em> creates points along input 2D or 3D lines,
boundaries and faces. Point features including centroids and kernels
are copied from input vector map to the output. For details see notes
about <b>type</b> parameter.

<p>
The output is a vector map with 2 layers. Layer 1 holds the category
of the input features; all points created along the same line have the
same category, equal to the category of that line. In layer 2 each
point has it's unique category; other attributes stored in layer 2
are <em>lcat</em> - the category of the input line and <em>along</em>
- the distance from line's start.

<p>
By default only features with category are processed,
see <b>llayer</b> parameter for details.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The <b>dmax</b> parameter is the maximum limit but not an exact
distance. To place points with exact distance from the beginning of
the vector line the user should use
<em><a href="v.segment.html">v.segment</a></em>.

<p>
Set <b>llayer</b> to -1 to process features from all layers including
features without category. Features will be assigned new unique
categories at layer 1. Option <b>llayer=-1</b> should be used to
convert boundaries, as in most of cases boundaries lack category
values.

<p>
The <b>type</b> parameter is used to control which input vector
geometry types to convert into points. Some caveats to consider about
this parameter:

<ul>
  <li>
    Points and centroids can be considered as "lines" with only one
    node. Consequently, the result of selecting <em>point</em> or
    <em>centroid</em> as the type parameter is that all
    points/centroids get written into the output vector map. The
    original category numbers of the input points/centroids get
    written to the '<em>lcat</em>' attribute in layer 2 of the output
    vector map. All values for <em>along</em> are zero in the output
    vector map, as only point geometry was used for input (there is no
    linear distance to calculate
    <em>along</em>, as each point/centroid is the start <em>and</em>
    end of its own "line").</li>
  <li>
    Boundaries are treated as lines, with points getting interpolated
    along the boundary perimeter according to <b>dmax</b>. If two
    adjoining polygons share a topological boundary, the boundary only
    gets converted to points once.</li>
  <li>
    If the <b>type</b> parameter is set to <em>area</em>, the boundary of
    each area is converted to points <i>regardless</i> of whether or not
    there is a topological boundary between adjacent areas. In other
    words, the common boundary of two adjoining areas, for example, gets
    converted to points twice. The centroid is not converted to a point in
    the output vector for <em>type=area</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <b>use=vertex</b> option is used to digitize points that fall on
the line's vertices <em>only</em>. Parameter <b>dmax</b> is ignored in
this case. Similarly to <b>use=node</b> when only line's node are
used.

<p>
If the <b>-i</b> flag is used in conjunction with
the <b>use=vertex</b> option,
<em>v.to.points</em> will digitize points on the line vertices, as
well as interpolate points between line vertices using <b>dmax</b> as
the maximum allowable spacing.

<p>
To get points created for the beginning, middle and end only, use
the <b>-i</b> flag and set <b>dmax</b> so that:

<div class="code"><pre>
 (length of input line / 2) &lt;= <em>dmax</em> &lt;= length of input line
</pre></div>

So if <b>dmax</b> is between 0.5x and 1.0x the line length, you will
always get points created at exactly the beginning, middle and end of
the input line.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

In this example, the 't_powerlines' vector lines map in the
<a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/download/data6.php">Spearfish 6</a>
location is used to create points along the input lines:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.to.points in=t_powerlines out=t_powerlines_points dmax=120
</pre></div>
