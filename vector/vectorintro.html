<h2>Vector data processing in GRASS GIS</h2>

<h3>Vector maps in general</h3>

A "vector map" is a data layer consisting of a number of sparse features
in geographic space. These might be data points (drill sites), lines
(roads), polygons (park boundary), volumes (3D CAD structure), or some
combination of all these. Typically each feature in the map will be
tied to a set of attribute layers stored in a database (road names,
site ID, geologic type, etc.). As a general rule these can exist in 2D
or 3D space and are independent of the GIS's computation region.


<h3>Vector data import and export</h3>

The <a href="v.in.ogr.html">v.in.ogr</a> module offers a common
interface for many different vector formats. Additionally, it
offers options such as on-the-fly creation of new locations or extension of
the default region to match the extent of the imported vector map.
For special cases, other import modules are available, e.g.
<a href="v.in.ascii.html">v.in.ascii</a> for input from a text file 
containing coordinate and attribute data, and 
<a href="v.in.db.html">v.in.db</a> for input from a database containing 
coordinate and attribute data.

With <a href="v.external.html">v.external</a> external maps can be
virtually linked into a mapset, only pseudo-topology is generated but
the vector geometry is not imported.

The <em>v.out.*</em> set of commands exports to various formats. To import
and export only attribute tables, use <a href="db.in.ogr.html">db.in.ogr</a>
and <a href="db.out.ogr.html">db.out.ogr</a>.

The naming convention for vector maps requires that map names start with a
character, not a number (map name scheme: [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*).

<h3>Metadata</h3>

The <a href="v.info.html">v.info</a> display general information such
as metadata and attribute columns about a vector map including the
history how it was generated. Each map generating command stores the
command history into the metadata (query with <a href="v.info.html">v.info -h mapname</a>).
Metadata such as map title, scale, organization etc. can be updated
with <a href="v.support.html">v.support</a>.


<h3>Vector map operations</h3>

GRASS vector map processing is always performed on the full map.
If this is not desired, the input map has to be clipped to the
current region beforehand (<a href="v.in.region.html">v.in.region</a>,
<a href="v.overlay.html">v.overlay</a>,<a href="v.select.html">v.select</a>).

<h3>Vector model and topology</h3>

GRASS is a topological GIS. This means that adjacent geographic
components in a single vector map are related. For example in a
non-topological GIS if two areas shared a common border that border
would be digitized two times and also stored in duplicate. In a
topological GIS this border exists once and is shared between two
areas.  Topological represenation of vector data helps to produce and
maintain vector maps with clean geometry as well as enables certain
analyses that can not be conducted with non-topological or spaghetti
data. In GRASS topological data are refered to as level 2 data and
spaghetti data is referred to as level 1.
<p>
Sometimes topology is not necessary and the additional memory and
space requirements are burdensome to a particular task. Therefore two
modules allow for working level 1 (non-topological) data within
GRASS. The <a href="v.in.ascii.html">v.in.ascii</a> module allows
users to input points without building topology. This is very useful
for large files where memory restrictions may cause difficulties. The
other module which works with level 1 data is 
<a href="v.surf.rst.html">v.surf.rst</a> which enables spatial
approximation and topographic analysis from a point or isoline file.

<p> In GRASS, the following vector object types are defined:

<ul>
<li> point: a point; </li>
<li> line: a directed sequence of connected vertices with two endpoints called nodes; </li>
<li> boundary: the border line to describe an area; </li>
<li> centroid: a point within a closed ring of boundaries; </li>
<li> area: the topological composition of a closed ring of boundaries and optionally a centroid; </li>
<li> face: a 3D area; </li>
<li> kernel: a 3D centroid in a volume (not yet implemented); </li>
<li> volume: a 3D corpus, the topological composition of faces and kernel (not yet implemented). </li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that all lines and boundaries can be polylines (with vertices in between).
<p>
Area topology also holds information about isles. These isles are located
within that area, not touching the boundaries of the outer area. Isles
consist of one or more areas and are used internally to maintain correct
topology for areas.

<P>
The <a href="v.type.html">v.type</a> module can be used to convert
between vector types if
possible. The <a href="v.build.html">v.build</a> module is used to
generate topology. It optionally allows to extract the erroneous
vector objects into a separate map. Topological errors can be
corrected either manually
within <a href="wxGUI.Vector_Digitizing_Tool.html">wxGUI vector
digitizer</a> or, to some extent, automatically
in <a href="v.clean.html">v.clean</a>.  A dedicated vector editing
module is <a href="v.edit.html">v.edit</a> which supports global and
local editing operations.

Adjacent polygons can be found by <a href="v.to.db.html">v.to.db</a>
(see 'sides' option).
<P>
Many operations including extraction, queries, overlay, and export will
only act on features which have been assigned a category number. Typically
a centroid will hold the attribute data for the area between it and its
boundaries. Boundaries are not typically given a category ID as it would be
ambiguous as to which area either side of it the attribute data would belong
to. An exception might be when the boundary between two crop-fields is the
center-line of a road, and the category information is an index to the road
name. For everyday use boundaries and centroids can be treated as internal
data types and the user can work directly and more simply with the "area"
meta-feature type.


<h3>Vector object categories and attribute management</h3>

GRASS vectors can be linked to one or many database management systems
(DBMS). The <em>db.*</em> set of commands provides basic SQL support for
attribute management, while the <em>v.db.*</em> set of commands operates
on a table linked to a vector map.

<ul>
<li><b>Categories</b><br>
Categories are used to categorize vector objects and link
attribute(s) to each category. Each vector object can have zero, one or
several categories. Category numbers do not have to be unique for
each vector object, several vector objects can share the same category.
<br>Category numbers are stored both within the geometry file for each
vector object and within the attribute table(s) (usually the "cat"
column). It is not required that attribute table(s) hold an entry for
each category, and attribute table(s) can hold
information about categories not present in the vector geometry file.
This means that e.g. an attribute table can be populated first and then
vector objects can be added to the geometry file with category numbers.
Using <a href="v.category.html">v.category</a>, category numbers can be
printed or maintained. 
<br><br></li>

<li><b>Layers</b><br>
It is possible to link the geographic objects in
a vector map to one or more tables. Each link to a distinct
attribute table is called a layer. A link defines which database
driver, database and table is to be used. Each category number in a
geometry file is associated with a layer and corresponds to a row in the
attribute table for this layer (the linking column is usually the "cat"
key column). Using <a href="v.db.connect.html">v.db.connect</a> layers
can be listed or maintained.<br>
Vector objects are not organized in layers. All vector
objects are kept in one geometry file, and topology is maintained for
all vector objects together. GRASS layers only consist of links to
different attribute tables in which vector objects can have zero, one or
more categories. If a vector object has zero categories in a layer, then
it does not appear in that layer. In this fashion some vector objects
may appear in some layers but not in others. The practical benefit of
this system is that it allows placement of thematically distinct but
topologically related objects into a single map (e.g. forests and lakes).
These virtual layers are also useful for linking time series attribute
data to a series of locations that did not change over time. By default
the first layer is active, i.e. the first table corresponds to the first
layer. Further tables are linked to subsequent layers.
<br><br></li>

<li><b>SQL support</b><br>
The DBF driver provides only very limited SQL support (as DBF is not an
SQL DB) while the other DBMS backends (such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL
etc) provide full SQL support since the SQL commands are sent directly
to the DBMI. SQL commands can be directly executed with
<a href="db.execute.html">db.execute</a>,
<a href="db.select.html">db.select</a> and the other db.* modules.
</li>
</ul>

When creating vector maps from scratch, in general an attribute table must be created and
the table must be populated with one row per category (using <a href="v.to.db.html">v.to.db</a>).
However, this can be performed in a single step using <a href="v.db.addtable.html">v.db.addtable</a>
along with the definition of table column types. Column adding and dropping
can be done with <a HREF="v.db.addcolumn.html">v.db.addcolumn</a> and
<a HREF="v.db.dropcolumn.html">v.db.dropcolumn</a>. A table column can be renamed with
<a HREF="v.db.renamecolumn.html">v.db.renamecolumn</a>. To drop a table from a map, use
<a HREF="v.db.droptable.html">v.db.droptable</a>. Values in a table can be updated
with <a HREF="v.db.update.html">v.db.update</a>. Tables can be joined with with
<a HREF="v.db.join.html">v.db.join</a>.


<h3>Editing vector attributes</h3>

To manually edit attributes of a table, the map has to be
queried in 'edit mode' using <a href="d.what.vect.html">d.what.vect</a>.
To bulk process attributes, it is recommended to use SQL
(<a href="db.execute.html">db.execute</a>).

<h3>Geometry operations</h3>

The module <a href="v.in.region.html">v.in.region</a> saves the
current region boundary into a vector area.

Split vector lines can be changes to polylines by
<a href="v.build.polylines.html">v.build.polylines</a>. Long lines can be
split by <a href="v.split.html">v.split</a> and
<a href="v.segment.html">v.segment</a>.

Buffer and circles can be generated with <a href="v.buffer.html">v.buffer</a>
and <a href="v.parallel.html">v.parallel</a>.

<a href="v.generalize.html">v.generalize</a> is module for generalization of GRASS vector maps.

2D vector maps can be changed to 3D using
<a href="v.drape.html">v.drape</a> or <a href="v.extrude.html">v.extrude</a>.
If needed, the spatial position of vector points can be perturbed by
<a href="v.perturb.html">v.perturb</a>.

The <a href="v.type.html">v.type</a> command changes between vector
types (see list above). 

Projected vector maps can be reprojected with <a href="v.proj.html">v.proj</a>.
Unprojected maps can be geocoded with <a href="v.transform.html">v.transform</a>.

Triangulation and point-to-polygon conversions can be done with <a
href="v.delaunay.html">v.delaunay</a>, <a href="v.hull.html">v.hull</a>,
and <a href="v.voronoi.html">v.voronoi</a>.

The <a href="v.random.html">v.random</a> command generated random points.

<h3>Vector overlays and selections</h3>

Geometric overlay of vector maps is done with <a href="v.patch.html">v.patch</a>,
<a href="v.overlay.html">v.overlay</a> and <a href="v.select.html">v.select</a>,
depending on the combination of vector types.

Vectors can be extracted with <a href="v.extract.html">v.extract</a>
and reclassified with <a href="v.reclass.html">v.reclass</a>.


<h3>Vector statistics</h3>

Statistics can be generated by <a href="v.qcount.html">v.qcount</a>,
<a href="v.sample.html">v.sample</a>, <a href="v.normal.html">v.normal</a>,
and <a href="v.univar.html">v.univar</a>.

Distances between vector objects are calculated with <a href="v.distance.html">v.distance</a>.

<h3>Vector-Raster-DB conversion</h3>

The <a href="v.to.db.html">v.to.db</a> transfers vector information
into database tables.

With <a href="v.to.points.html">v.to.points</a>,
<a href="v.to.rast.html">v.to.rast</a> and <a href="v.to.rast3.html">v.to.rast3</a>
conversions are performed.

<h3>Vector queries</h3>

Vector maps can be queried with <a href="v.what.html">v.what</a> and
<a href="v.what.vect.html">v.what.vect</a>.

<h3>Vector-Raster queries</h3>

Raster values can be transferred to vector maps with 
 <a href="v.what.rast.html">v.what.rast</a> and
<a href="v.rast.stats">v.rast.stats</a>.

<h3>Vector network analysis</h3>

GRASS provides support for vector network analysis. The following algorithms
are implemented:

<ul>
<li> Network preparation and maintenance: <a href="v.net.html">v.net</a></li>
<li> Shortest path: <a href="d.path.html">d.path</a> and 
     <a href="v.net.path.html">v.net.path</a></li>
<li> Shortest path between all pairs of nodes <a href="v.net.allpairs.html">v.net.allpairs</a>
<li> Allocation of sources (create subnetworks, e.g. police station zones):
     <a href="v.net.alloc.html">v.net.alloc</a></li>
<li> Iso-distances (from centers): <a href="v.net.iso.html">v.net.iso</a></li>
<li> Computes bridges and articulation points: <a href="v.net.bridge.html">v.net.bridge</a></li>
<li> Computes degree, centrality, betweeness, closeness and eigenvector centrality measures: <a href="v.net.centrality.html">v.net.centrality</a></li>
<li> Computes strongly and weakly connected components: <a href="v.net.components.html">v.net.components</a></li>
<li> Computes vertex connectivity between two sets of nodes: <a href="v.net.connectivity.html">v.net.connectivity</a></li>
<li> Computes shortest distance via the network between the given sets of features: <a href="v.net.distance.html">v.net.distance</a></li>
<li> Computes the maximum flow between two sets of nodes: <a href="v.net.flow.html">v.net.flow</a></li>
<li> Computes minimum spanning tree:<a href="v.net.spanningtree.html">v.net.spanningtree</a></li>
<li> Minimum Steiner trees (star-like connections, e.g. broadband cable
     connections): <a href="v.net.steiner.html">v.net.steiner</a></li>
<li> Finds shortest path using timetables: <a href="v.net.timetable.html">v.net.timetable</a></li>
<li> Traveling salesman (round trip): <a href="v.net.salesman.html">v.net.salesman</a></li>
</ul>

Vector directions are defined by the digitizing direction (a--&gt;--b).
Both directions are supported, most network modules provide parameters
to assign attribute columns to the forward and backward direction.

<h3>Vector networks: Linear referencing system (LRS)</h3>

LRS uses linear features and distance measured along those features to
positionate objects. There are the commands
<a href="v.lrs.create.html">v.lrs.create</a> to create a linear reference system,
<a href="v.lrs.label.html">v.lrs.label</a> to create stationing on the LRS, 
<a href="v.lrs.segment.html">v.lrs.segment</a> to create points/segments on LRS,
 and
<a href="v.lrs.where.html">v.lrs.where</a> to find line id and real km+offset 
for given points in vector map using linear reference system.
<p>
The <a href="lrs.html">LRS tutorial</a> explains further details.


<h3>Interpolation and approximation</h3>

Some of the vector modules deal with spatial or volumetric
approximation (also called interpolation):
<a href="v.kernel.html">v.kernel</a>,
<a href="v.surf.idw.html">v.surf.idw</a>,
<a href="v.surf.rst.html">v.surf.rst</a>, and
<a href="v.vol.rst.html">v.vol.rst</a>.


<h3>Lidar data processing</h3>

Lidar point clouds (first and last return) are imported from text files 
with <a href="v.in.ascii.html">v.in.ascii</a> or from LAS files with
<a href="v.in.lidar.html"> v.in.lidar</a>. Both modules recognize the 
-b flag to not build topology. Outlier detection is done with 
<a href="v.outlier.html">v.outlier</a> on both first and last return data.
Then, with <a href="v.lidar.edgedetection.html">v.lidar.edgedetection</a>,
edges are detected from last return data. The building are generated by
<a href="v.lidar.growing.html">v.lidar.growing</a> from detected
edges.  The resulting data are post-processed with
<a href="v.lidar.correction.html">v.lidar.correction</a>. Finally, the
DTM and DSM are generated with <a href="v.surf.bspline.html">v.surf.bspline</a>
(DTM: uses the 'v.lidar.correction' output; DSM: uses last return output
from outlier detection).
