s.voronoi - Uses a GRASS sites list  to  produce  a  Voronoi diagram.
s.delauney - Uses a GRASS sites list  to  produce  to Delauney triangulation.

Both of these functions utilize s.sweep (located in the ETC directory
instead of BIN_MAIN_CMD). s.sweep is a slightly modified version of sweep2,
which can be found on netlib sites (e.g., research.att.com).

-------------------------
This was developed from something called sweep2,
which can be found on netlib sites (e.g., research.att.com). I
do not claim in any way to be an expert in computational geometry.
The only real additions that I made was the GRASS wrapper and making
a few cosmetic changes to Fortune's output routines.

There's a few places where the code needs cleaning up (i.e., there's a
few areas where I need to do some re-allocation of memory, but I didn't get
around to doing this).

This is a complete re-write of the old s.voronoi. If you find any bugs,
let me know.

UPDATE 1/5/2001
I updtated McCauley file to address slowness, some numerical
problem related to line segment parameters in s.sweep output
and to improve speed. I also updated both commands to use
GRASS 5 site API. A speed improvement is still possible
by making s.sweep and s.voronoi/s.delaunay a single executable,
but up to now this does not make sense since most of the
time is spend in label output... Hoping to fix this in GRASS5.1

UPDATE 10/2004
- Copy grass/src/sites/s.voronoi to grass51/vector/v.voronoi
- Rewritten to read/write directly GRASS vector files.

-----------------------------------------
UPDATE 4/2008
- better memory management
- 3D support for Delaunay
- TODO: complete it for Voronoi if desired
