<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.timetable</em> finds the shortest path between two points 
using timetables. <em>v.net.timetable</em> reads input, one query per line,
from the standard input and writes output to the standard output as well as 
to the <b>output</b> map and to tables linked to layers 1 and 2. 
Each line of input must follow one of the following formats:
<div class="code"><pre>
PATH_ID FROM_X FROM_Y TO_X TO_Y START_TIME MIN_CHANGE MAX_CHANGES WALK_CHANGE
PATH_ID FROM_STOP TO_STOP START_TIME MIN_CHANGE MAX_CHANGES WALK_CHANGE
</pre></div>
where PATH_ID is the identificator of a query that is used in the 
output map to differentiate between queries. Search begins at 
START_TIME. MIN_CHANGE gives the minimum number of time 
(inclusively) for a change from one route to another. MAX_CHANGES 
denotes the maximum number of changes allowed or -1 if infinity. 
WALK_CHANGE is 1 or 0 depending whether walking from a stop to 
another stop is considered a change or not. Finally, the path is 
found from FROM_STOP to TO_STOP in latter case and from the stop 
closest to (FROM_X, FROM_Y) coordinates to the stop closest to 
(TO_X, TO_Y) coordinates in former case.
<br>
For each input query, module outputs a description of the shortest 
path to the standard output. For example, using the tables given 
below, for the following input:
<div class="code"><pre>
47 130 300 0 1 5 0
</pre></div>
the following output is produced:
<div class="code"><pre>
Route 15, from 130 leaving at 15 arriving to 250 at 22
Walk from 250 leaving at 22 arriving to 300 at 24
</pre></div>
Moreover, the module writes the path to the <b>output</b> map and 
stores all the information necessary to reconstruct the path to the 
tables. Table corresponding to stops/points is linked to layer 1 and 
looks, after the query, as follows:
<div class="code"><pre>
cat|path_id|stop_id|index|arr_time|dep_time
1|47|130|1|0|15
2|47|250|2|22|22
3|47|300|3|24|24
</pre></div>  
where CAT is the category of a point in the map, PATH_ID is the path 
identificator, STOP_ID is the identificator of the stop as used in 
the input map, INDEX is the index of the stop on the path (i.e, 
index=1 is the first stop visited, ...) and ARR_TIME and DEP_TIME 
denote the arrival time and departure time respectively. Arrival 
time for the first stop on the path is always equal to START_TIME 
and departure time for the last stop is always equal to the arrival 
time.
<br>
The table linked to the second layer corresponds to subroutes taken 
between stops. The following table is obtainedd for the above query:
<div class="code"><pre>
cat|path_id|from_id|to_id|route_id|index|from_time|to_time
1|47|130|250|15|1|15|22
2|47|250|300|-1|2|22|24
</pre></div>
where CAT is the category of lines of subroute between stops FROM_ID 
to TO_ID, ROUTE_ID is the identificator of the route taken or -1 if 
walking, INDEX and PATH_ID are as above and FROM_TIME and TO_TIME 
denote the times between which the route is taken.
<br>
The <b>output</b> map contains the points on the positions of used 
stops. If a subroute is taken between two stops then a line segment 
is added between two corresponding points. Finally, instead of 
straight line segment, the actual paths of routes can be given in <b>
paths</b> layer. If this parameter is used then each line in the 
input map must contain identificators as category numbers of all 
routes passing through the line. The module then finds the path 
between two stops and writes this path instead. In case of walking 
from one stop to another, straight line between the stops is used.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Timetables are stored in a table linked to the given <b>layer</b> of 
the <b>input</b> map. Timetable consists of routes and each route is 
just a sequence of stops with specified arrival times. If two 
sequences of stops differ only in times then they still correspond 
to two routes. For example, if there is a bus line that leaves every 
20 minutes and follow exactly the same path every time then there 
still needs to be a separate route for every time. For each stop 
(given by the category number of the point) the table storing 
information about the routes must contain the list of all routes 
stopping at the stop(given by route identificators) together with 
arrival times. That is, the table must contain three columns: stop - 
which is the key of the table, <b>route_id</b> and <b>stop_time</b> 
where each triple corresponds to a route arriving to a stop and a 
certain time. For example, a valid table might look as 
follows:
<div class="code"><pre>
cat|route_id|stop_time
100|5|0
130|5|10
150|5|20
250|5|30
300|5|40
260|15|5
130|15|15
250|15|22
150|35|17
250|35|27
300|35|37
100|35|50
</pre></div>
Note that <b>stop_time</b> is an integer and so you can use any 
units and offest to specify arrival times.<br> Also, walking 
connections between stops can be given by a table linked to <b>
walking</b> layer of the <b>input</b> map. If this parameter is -1 
then walking between stops is not allowed. The table must contain 
three columns: stop - which is the key of the table, <b>to_stop</b> 
and <b>length</b>. A record in the table says that it takes <b>length
</b> units of time to walk from stop to <b>to_stop</b>. The 
following is a valid table:
<div class="code"><pre>
cat|length|to_stop
250|2|300
</pre></div>
Beware that this only means that it is possible to walk from stop 
250 to stop 300 but not the other way round.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

To find a path from stop with identificator 130 to stop with 
category 300, starting at time 0, with one time unit for change, 
maximum of 5 changes and with walking not considered a change of 
route, we use the following command:
<div class="code"><pre>
echo "47 130 300 0 1 5 0" | v.net.timetable \
     input=buses output=path layer=5 walking=6 path=7
</pre></div>

If, on the other hand, we know the coordinates of the places then the 
following command might be used: 
<div class="code"><pre>
echo "47 10.31 54.31 90.21 28.21 0 1 5 0" | v.net.timetable \
     input=buses output=path layer=5 walking=6 path=7
</pre></div>
