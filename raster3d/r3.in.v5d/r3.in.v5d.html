<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/vis5d.html">Vis5D</a> is a system
for interactive visualization of large 5D gridded data sets such as those
produced by numerical weather models. One can make isosurfaces, contour
line slices, colored slices, volume renderings, etc of data in a 3D grid,
then rotate and animate the images in real time. There's also a feature
for wind trajectory tracing, a way to make text anotations for publications,
support for interactive data analysis, etc.
<br>r3.in.v5d imports 3-dimensional files (i.e. the v5d file with 1 variable
and 1 time step). Otherwise, only first variable and timestep from 4/5D
v5d file will be imported.
