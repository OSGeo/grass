## DESCRIPTION

*r3.in.v5d* imports 3-dimensional files (i.e. the V5D file with one
variable and one time step). Otherwise, only first variable and timestep
from 4/5D V5D file will be imported.

[Vis5D](https://vis5d.sourceforge.net/) is a system for interactive
visualization of large 5D gridded data sets such as those produced by
numerical weather models. The user can make isosurfaces, contour line
slices, colored slices, volume renderings, etc. of data in a 3D raster
map, then rotate and animate the images in real time. There's also a
feature for wind trajectory tracing, a way to make text annotations for
publications, support for interactive data analysis, etc.
