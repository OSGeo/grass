<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b>r3.support</b> allows the user to create and/or edit raster3d map support 
information. Editing of raster3d map units, history, description and title is supported. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>
Freeform metadata information is stored in a "<tt>hist</tt>" file which may be
appended to by using the <b>history</b> option. Currently this is limited to
text with a maximum line length of 78 characters. Any input
larger than this will be wrapped to the next line.
All other metadata strings available as standard options are limited to
79 characters.
