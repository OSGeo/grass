## DESCRIPTION

**r3.support** allows the user to create and/or edit raster3d map
support information. Editing of raster3d map units, history, description
and title is supported.

## NOTES

Freeform metadata information is stored in a "`hist`" file which may be
appended to by using the **history** option. Currently this is limited
to text with a maximum line length of 78 characters. Any input larger
than this will be wrapped to the next line. All other metadata strings
available as standard options are limited to 79 characters.
