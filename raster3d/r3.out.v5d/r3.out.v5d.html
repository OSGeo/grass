<p><a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/vis5d.html">Vis5D</a> is a system
for interactive visualization of large 5D gridded data sets such as those
produced by numerical weather models. The user can make isosurfaces, contour
line slices, colored slices, volume renderings, etc. of data in a 3D raster map,
then rotate and animate the images in real time. There's also a feature
for wind trajectory tracing, a way to make text anotations for publications,
support for interactive data analysis, etc.
