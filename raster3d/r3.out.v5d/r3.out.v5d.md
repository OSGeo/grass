## DESCRIPTION

Exports 3D raster maps to V5D format. The *map* parameter is a valid 3D
raster map in the current mapset search path. The *output* parameter is
the name of a V5D file which will be written in the current working
directory.

[Vis5D](https://vis5d.sourceforge.net/) is a system for interactive
visualization of large 5D gridded data sets such as those produced by
numerical weather models. The user can make isosurfaces, contour line
slices, colored slices, volume renderings, etc. of data in a 3D raster
map, then rotate and animate the images in real time. There's also a
feature for wind trajectory tracing, a way to make text annotations for
publications, support for interactive data analysis, etc.
