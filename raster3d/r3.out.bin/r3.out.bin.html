<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r3.out.bin</em> program exports a GRASS 3D raster map to a binary array
file. Optionally, output can be send to standard output (stdout) for direct
input (pipe) into other applications. Data is exported according to the
original GRASS 3D raster type (float, double).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The write order of the rows (north->south to south->north) and
the write order of the depths (bottom->top to top->bottom) can be switched.
<p>
The region parameters are printed to stderr when setting the verbose flag.
Export of little and big endian byte order is supported.
<p>
Have a look at <a href="r3.out.ascii.html">r3.out.ascii</a> manual page that
describes the internal layout of the 3D raster maps and the supported
row and depth switch options.
