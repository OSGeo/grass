</font>The porting effort from IrisGL to OpenGL was performed with the goal of just getting things to run with
OpenGL with some user-interface improvements. Only a small attempt was made to correct for sloppy/dangerous coding
practices found in the <b>original</b> code. Sloppy/dangerous coding practices were modified only when they resulted
in serious code errors (causing core dumps). Certain files, such as new_init_graphics.c, which were totally new
files, were coded to higher standards. In general, this effort was only a porting effort, <b>not</b> a re-architecting
effort.<br>
