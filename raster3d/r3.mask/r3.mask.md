## DESCRIPTION

*r3.mask* facilitates the creation of a raster3d "MASK" map to control
raster3d operations. The raster3d *map* is used as the reference map.
Cells in the mask are marked as "mask out" if the corresponding cell in
*map* contains a value in the range specified with *maskvalues*.

## NOTES

Before a new 3D-mask can be created the existing mask has to be removed
with *g.remove*.
