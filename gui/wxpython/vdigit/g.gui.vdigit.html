<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b>Vector digitizer</b> is a <em><a href="wxGUI.html">wxGUI</a></em>
component intended for interactive editing and digitizing vector maps
(see <em><a href="v.edit.html">v.edit</a></em> for non-interactive
vector editing GRASS capabilities).

<p>
Note that only vector maps from the current mapset is possible to open
for editing.

<p>
The digitizer allows editing 2D vector features only (points, lines,
centroids, boundaries, and areas).

Vector features can be selected by mouse (bounding box or simply by
mouse click, see select threshold
in <i>Settings&rarr;General&rarr;Select threshold</i>), or by query
(eg. by line length, see <i>Settings&rarr;Query Tool</i>).

<p>
Vector digitizer can be launched from Map Display toolbar by selecting
&quot;Digitize&quot; from <i>Tools</i> combobox. Vector map is
selectable for editing from Digitizer toolbar (&quot;Select vector
map&quot; combobox, note that only vector maps from the current layer
tree in Layer Manager are listed).

Vector digitizer can be alternatively also activated from contextual
menu in Layer Manager by selecting "Start editing" on selected vector
map in the layer tree, or directly from Layer Manager
toolbar <img src="icons/edit.png" alt="icon">.

Vector digitizer also can be launched from the command line as
stand-alone application <em>g.gui.vdigit</em>.

<p>
New vector map can be easily created from digitizer toolbar by
selecting &quot;New vector map&quot; in &quot;Select vector map&quot;
combobox. A new vector map is created, added to the current layer tree
in Layer Manager and opened for editing. &quot;Select vector map&quot;
combobox in digitizer toolbar also allows switching easily between
vector maps to be edited.
<p>
Vector digitizer allows to define &quot;background&quot; vector map. A
background map can be selected from map layer contextual menu in Layer
Manager (&quot;Use as Background Map&quot;). Newly digitized vector
features are snapped in the given threshold to the features from the
background map. Vector features may be also copied from the background
map by &quot;Copy features from (background) vector map&quot; tool
from the digitizer toolbar.

    <em>Additional tools</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Break selected lines/boundaries at intersection</em><br> Split
	given vector line or boundary into two lines on given position
	(based on <em><a href="v.clean.html">v.clean</a></em>,
	<tt>tool=break</tt>).</li>

      <li><em>Connect two selected lines/boundaries</em><br> Connect selected
	lines or boundaries, the first given line is connected to the
	second one. The second line is broken if necessary on each intersection.
	The lines are connected only if distance between them is not greater
	than snapping threshold value.</li>

      <li><em>Copy categories</em><br>Copy category settings of
	selected vector feature to other vector
	features. Layer/category pairs of source vector features are
	appended to the target feature category settings. Existing
	layer/category pairs are not removed from category settings of
	the target features.</li>

      <li><em>Copy features from (background) map</em><br> Make identical copy of
	selected vector features. If a background vector map has been 
	selected from the Layer Manager, copy features from background 
	vector map, not from the currently modified vector map.</li>

      <li><em>Copy attributes</em><br>Duplicate attributes settings of
	selected vector feature to other vector features. New
	category(ies) is appended to the target feature category
	settings and attributes duplicated based on category settings
	of source vector features. Existing layer/category pairs are
	not removed from category settings of the target
	features.</li>

      <li><em>Feature type conversion</em><br> Change feature type of selected
	geometry features. Points are converted to centroids,
	centroids to points, lines to boundaries and boundaries to
	lines.</li>

      <li><em>Flip selected lines/boundaries</em><br> Flip direction of
	selected linear features (lines or boundaries).</li>

      <li><em>Merge selected lines/boundaries</em><br> Merge (at least two)
	selected vector lines or boundaries. The geometry of the
	merged vector lines can be changed. If the second line from
	two selected lines is in opposite direction to the first, it
	will be flipped. See also
	module <em><a href="v.build.polylines.html">v.build.polylines</a></em>.</li>

      <li><em>Snap selected lines/boundaries (only to nodes)</em><br> Snap
	vector features in given threshold. See also
	module <em><a href="v.clean.html">v.clean</a></em>. Note that
	this tool supports only snapping to nodes. Snapping to vector
	features from background vector map is not currently
	supported.</li>

      <li><em>Split line/boundary</em><br>Split selected line or boundary on
      given position.</li>

      <li><em>Query tool</em><br>Select vector features by defining a threshold for
        min/max length value (linear features or dangles).</li>

      <li><em>Z-bulk labeling of 3D lines</em><br> Assign z coordinate values to 3D
	vector lines in bounding box. This is useful for labeling contour lines.</li>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<dl><dt><b>Mouse button functions:</b><dd>
	<dt><i>Left</i>   - select or deselect features</dt>
	<dt><i>Control+Left</i> - cancel action or undo vertex when digitizing lines</dt>
	<dt><i>Right</i>  - confirm action</dt>
</dl>

<p>
<i>Dead (deleted)</i> are internally only marked in the geometry file
as 'dead' but it remains there and occupies space. Any vector module
used afterwards on this vector map which really reads and writes
vector geometry (so not <em><a href="g.copy.html">g.copy</a></em>)
will writes only features which are 'alive'.

<p>
<i>Added or modified</i> vector features are <i>snapped</i> to
existing vector features (Settings&rarr;General&rarr;Snapping). To
disable snapping set the snapping threshold to '0'.

<p>
If the digitizer crashes for some reason, the changes are
automatically saved. Broken topology can be repaired by running
<em><a href="v.build.html">v.build</a></em>.
