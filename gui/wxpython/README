2 - STARTUP WITH GRASS INITIALIZATION

If you want to launch wxPython GUI automatically when you start
GRASS, edit your .grass7/rc file to replace

GRASS_GUI: tcltk (or whatever you have here)

with

GRASS_GUI: wxpython

or easier start new GRASS session with -wxpython switch.

$ grass70 -wxpython


3 - STARTUP FROM GRASS TERMINAL

Simply run

$ g.gui wxpython

from the GRASS terminal.

You can also specify workspace file to load on startup.

$ g.gui gui=wxpython workspace=myworkspace.gxw


4 - CLI Display scripts

Note: This section is out-dated!

This is going to be replacement for command line tools like d.rast and
d.vect.

Now add directory "scripts" in gui directory to your $PATH. These
little programs should later go to GRASS Scripts directory or became
Python scripts or C programs. Now they are only small BASH wrappers
which can be easily and fast customized.

$~ export PATH=scripts/:$PATH

Start GRASS:

$~ grass70 ~/grassdata/spearfish60/user1

Use command p.mon (shell script in gui/scripts directory) to start map
display:

GRASS> p.mon anything

After a while, new window should appear.  If this is your case, add some
raster layer to the map display:

GRASS> p.rast aspect

What about a bit transparency?

GRASS> p.rast elevation.dem opacity=0.5

And try the vector layer too

GRASS> p.vect roads

NOTE: only map name is currently supported. No other option will influence
      the map layout

Alternatively you can use more universal p.cmd:

GRASS> p.cmd "d.rast map=elevation.dem@PERMANENT catlist=1300-1400 -i"

You should be able to zoom && pan through the map, once the layers are
displayed. You should be also able to store the display content as well as
clear the display and start from scratch.


5 - DEBUGGING

To enable GUI debug messages on given level set GRASS_DEBUG_WX
environment variable, e.g.

$ export GRASS_WX_DEBUG=3


6 - VECTOR DIGITIZER

To enable digitizer you need to compile 'vdigit' component. Note that
you must configure GRASS with C++ (--with-cxx), Python (--with-python)
and wxWidgets (--with-wxwidgets) support.

$ cd gui/wxpython/vdigit
$ make
$ make install
