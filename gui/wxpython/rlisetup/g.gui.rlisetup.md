## DESCRIPTION

The **g.gui.rlisetup** is a *[wxGUI](wxGUI.md)* component which allows
the user to create a configuration file for the analytical *r.li*
modules. For a general introduction, see the [r.li](r.li.md) overview.  
The configurations are raster map independent, it means that you can use
a file created on a raster map for analyze any other you have.  
The program is completely interactive and uses a GUI to help you in your
choices.

### Analysis methods

Definition of creation of sampling area:

- Whole map layer: use entire area selected above,
- Regions: select one to many subareas via mouse,
- Sample units: automated selection of sampling area (for details see
  below)
  - Random nonoverlapping,
  - Systematic contiguous,
  - Systematic noncontiguous,
  - Stratified random,
  - Centered over sites (vector points).
- Moving window: rectangular or circular with size

Definition of region for analysis:

- Whole map layer: entire map (current region),
- Keyboard setting: based on keyboard selection for region definition,
- Draw the sampling frame: based on interactive region selection via
  mouse.

### Usage details

The startup window shows your configuration files, you can:

**TODO: description below needs further updates**

1. ***View/Edit*** (Load a file) from the shown list: the configuration
    is shown in a small text editor window. Configuration files are
    saved in the folder `C:\Users\userxy\AppData\Roaming\GRASS8\r.li\`
    (MS-Windows) or `$HOME/.r.li/` (GNU/Linux) (the file name can be
    defined by the user). The output or an analysis can either be a new
    raster map (in case of using a "moving window" analysis) or be an
    ASCII text file (when not performing a "moving window" analysis)
    containing the result. Such text file will be saved in the folder
    `C:\Users\userxy\AppData\Roaming\GRASS8\r.li\output\` (MS-Windows)
    or `$HOME/.grass8/r.li/output/` (GNU/Linux).  
    All dimensions are percentages of raster rows or columns.
2. ***Create*** a new configuration file: used for creating a new
    configuration file in an interactive way, in three steps:
    1. Choose file name and maps to use for setting:
        - *Name for new configuration file*(required): the name of new
          configuration file
        - *Raster map name to use to select areas* (required): the name
          of raster map used for selecting sampling areas
        - *Vector map to overlay* (optional): name of a vector map used
          for selecting sampling areas
    2. Set the sampling frame. The sample frame is a rectangular area
        which contains all the areas to analyze. It can be defined in
        three ways:
        - *Whole map layer*: the sample frame is the whole map
        - *Keyboard setting*: the user enters the coordinates in cells
          of upper left corner of sampling frame and its length in rows
          and columns.
        - *Draw the sample frame*: the user draws the sample frame on
          map using mouse.
    3. Set the sample areas. The sample areas are simply the areas to
        analyze. They can be defined in five ways (see the picture
        below):
        - *Whole map layer*: the sample area is the whole sample frame
        - *Regions*: the user enters the number of areas and then draws
          them using mouse.
        - *Sample units*: they are areas of rectangular or circular
          shape. The user can define them using keyboard or mouse.
          - keyboard: the user define the shape of sample unists and
            their disposition:
            - *Random non overlapping*: the user specifies the number of
              sample units and they are placed in a random way at
              runtime. It is guaranteed that the areas do not intersect
              themselves.
            - *Systematic contiguous*: the defined sample is placed
              covering the sample frame, side by side across rows.
            - *Systematic non contiguous*: the same as above, but here
              ever rectangle is spaced from another by a specified
              number of cells.
            - *Stratified random*: the sample frame is divided in *n*
              strats of rows and *m* strats of columns (*n* and *m* are
              given by user), then the specified number of sample areas
              are placed in a random way, one for every *m\*n* areas
              defined by strats.
            - *Centered over sites*: the sample areas are placed into
              sample frame centering them on points in site file.
          - mouse: the user chooses the shape and then draws the
            specified number of sample areas on map.
        - *Moving Window:* the user defines a rectangular or circular
          area, it is moved over all the raster increasing only of a
          cell for every move(in columns if possible, if not in rows).
          It produces a new raster containing the result of all
          analysis.
        - *Select areas from the overlaid vector map*: the sample areas
          are defined by the vector map selected above. For every cat in
          vector map, the procedure prompts the user if they want to
          include it as sample area. The resulting configuration file
          can be used only with the specified raster map, and the
          procedure can be used only if whole map layer is selected as
          sampling frame.
3. ***Remove a file*** the selected file is deleted from the available
    configuration files.
4. ***Help***: open this help text.
5. ***Close*** module window.

## NOTES

Configuration files are raster map independent because areas are saved
using relative coordinates.

## EXAMPLES

### Moving window analysis on full region

*TODO: update examples to new g.gui.rlisetup dialog:*

Example for a 7x7 moving window analysis on full region, the output is a
raster map:

Click on "New", then:

- Configuration file name: "movwindow7"
- Raster map name to use to select areas: "forests"

1\. Setup sampling frame:

- Define a sampling frame (region for analysis): "Whole map layer", then
  "OK"

2\. Setup sampling frame

- Define sampling areas: "Moving window", then "OK"
- Then click on "Use keyboard to define moving window dimension"

Select type of shape:

- \[x\] Rectangular
- Width size (in cells)?: "7"
- Height size (in cells)?: "7"
- Then "Save settings"

3\. Save settings: click on button  
(4.) Close

Now an anaysis can be performed using one of the analytical modules,
e.g.

```sh
g.region raster=forests -p
r.li.patchdensity input=forests conf=movwindow7 output=forests_p_dens7
r.univar forests_p_dens7
```

The result is the new raster map "forests_p_dens7" which shows (in this
example) the patch density of the forest areas.  
See the respective modules for further examples.

### Whole region analysis

Example for a whole region analysis, the output is a text file: Click on
"New", then:

- Configuration file name: "whole_region"
- Raster map name to use to select areas: "lsat7_2000_40"

1\. Setup sampling frame:

- Define a sampling frame (region for analysis): "Whole map layer", then
  "OK"

2\. Setup sampling frame

- Define sampling areas: "Whole map layer", then "OK"

3\. Save settings: click on button  
(4.) Close

Now an anaysis can be performed using one of the analytical modules,
e.g.

```sh
g.region raster=lsat7_2002_40 -p
r.li.shannon input=lsat7_2000_40 conf=whole_region output=lsat7_2000_40_shannon
```

The result is the new text file "forests_p_dens7" (stored in folder
`$HOME/.r.li/output/`.  
See the respective modules for further examples.
