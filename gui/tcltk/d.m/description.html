<h2>DESCRIPTION - GIS MANAGER</h2>

<P>
<BR>

<i><b>
The </b>d.m<b> Tcl/Tk GIS manager GUI has been replaced by </b>gis.m<b>.
The </b>d.m<b> code is now UNMAINTAINED and OBSOLETE and left here as a
courtesy to legacy users. The </b>gis.m<b> GUI is soon to be replaced by a
new wxPython based GUI.

<P>
<BR>

The <b>GRASS GIS Manager</b>
provides an interactive graphical interface to GRASS commands. By
default, it is started automatically with each GRASS session. The GIS
Manager can be quit by selecting the <em>'File-&gt;Exit</em><em>'</em>
menu item. The GIS Manager can be restarted from the GRASS command line
shell by typing "<i>d.m &amp;</i>".<br>

<br>
The GIS Manager includes a set of pull-down menus for many GIS
functions (analysis, file I/O, GIS configuration and management), two
rows of buttons that control display functions, an upper window in
which layers to display are organized, a row of display monitor control
buttons along the left side of the layer tree window, and a lower
window which contains options panels for layers in the layer tree. <br>
<br>
The top row of buttons control a series of display functions:
displaying or redisplaying all map layers in the default monitor
window, zooming and panning, simple queries, starting NVIZ
(n-dimensional visualization) or XGANIM (display animator) display
interfaces, and saving or opening group display file. The second row of
buttons add, copy, or remove map layers to be displayed, and activate
the raster and vector digitizing interfaces. <em><b>Mouse-over help</b></em>
is available for all buttons.<br>
<br>
Map layers are organized as a layer tree, in the window below the
buttons. Layers can include raster and vector maps, text, map
enhancements (scale and north arrow, grids, and frames), and commands
(where any GRASS command be written). Layers are displayed in the order
added to the layer tree: the first added (i.e., at the top of the tree)
is displayed first, followed by the next added, etc. This means that
the uppermost layer is 'on the bottom' and the lowermost is 'on top' if
layers are thought of as a series of stacked overlays. Any layer can be
renamed by double clicking on its name and typing a new name.<br>
<br>
The check box to the left of each layer makes it active for display.
Active layers are only displayed/redisplayed when the display button is
pressed. Layers can be organized into groups; entire groups can be
activated or deactivated for display. Groups can be saved to a file and
opened in subsequent sessions, restoring all layers and their display
options.<br>
<br>
When a layer is selected with the mouse, its options are shown in the
panel below the layer tree window. Help for each layer type can be
accessed by pressing the GRASS button in the option panel.<br>
<br>
The monitor buttons along the left side of the layer tree window open
or select (if already open) one of seven display monitors (named
x0-x6). Layers are be displayed in the currently selected monitor. If
no monitor is open and selected, map layers will be displayed in
monitor x0. <br>

<em></em>

<h2>BUTTON FUNCTIONS (top row)</h2>



<h3>Display active layers (current region)</h3>
Displays all active layers at current resolution and region extents.
Monitor x0 will be started automatically if a monitor is not already
open and selected.

<h3>Display active layers (default region)</h3>
Resets the region to the default resolution and extents, and displays all
active layers. See <tt><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a> -d</tt>.

<h3>Display active layers (saved region)</h3>
Opens a dialog to select a saved region setting. Resets the region to
the resolution and extents of the selected saved region, and displays
all active layers. See <tt><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a></tt>.

<h3>Erase to white</h3>
Erases the currently selected monitor to a white background; also removes all frames. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.erase.html">d.erase</a> and <a href="d.frame.html">d.frame</a> -e.</span>
<h3>NVIZ</h3>
Starts the NVIZ, n-dimensional visualization module and interactive graphical interface. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="nviz.html">nviz</a></span><a href="nviz.html">.</a>
<h3>Fly through path for NVIZ</h3>
Starts a GRASS module for interactive creation of a fly-through path to be animated in NVIZ. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.nviz.html">d.nviz</a></span>.
<h3>Animate raster map series<br>
</h3>
Starts the XGANIM interactive interface to display a series of raster maps as an animation. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="xganim.html">xganim</a></span><a href="xganim.html">.</a>
<h3>Zoom</h3>
Interactive zooming with the mouse in the active display monitor.
Zooming resets the region extents (both size and location of area
displayed). A set of prompts for using the mouse for zooming will
appear in a separate x-terminal. A simple (i.e., non-draped) raster map
or vector map must be active and displayed in the current monitor. If
no map is currently active and displayed, a dialog will appear in which
a map can be chosen. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.zoom.html">d.zoom</a>.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Return to previous zoom</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Resets the region to the layer extents in effect prior to zooming.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pan and recenter</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Interactive selection of a new
center of view in the active display monitor. Panning changes the
location of the region extents but not the size of the area displayed.
A simple (i.e., non-draped) raster map or vector map must be active and
displayed in the current monitor for panning to function. <span style="font-style: italic;">See&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="d.zoom.html">d.zoom</a> -p</span>.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h3>Query map (select map first)</h3>
Query selected raster (only the base map of a draped map will be
queried), RGB raster map (all three map channels will be queried), or
vector map using the mouse. A map has to be
selected before query.
&nbsp;Vector charts and thematic vector maps cannot be queried. The
results of a raster map query will be displayed in a new x-terminal.
Depending on the setting in the vector panel, the results of a vector
map query will be displayed in&nbsp;graphical form window or in a new
x-terminal.<br>
<br>


The default display mode for vector map queries can also be set with the GRASS environment variable DM_FORM_MODE.

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><tt>g.gisenv set=DM_FORM_MODE=txt</tt> for displaying vector query results in an x-terminal
<br>
<tt>g.gisenv set=DM_FORM_MODE=gui </tt>for displaying vector query results in a graphical form window<br>
<br>
</div>
<span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.what.rast.html">d.what.rast</a> and <a href="d.what.vect.html">d.what.vect</a></span>.<br>

<h3>Measure lengths and areas</h3>
Interactive measurement of lengths and/or areas defined with the mouse.
An x-terminal will open with prompts for using the mouse to measure
lengths and areas, and display the results of measurement. Lengths are
measured in meters; areas are measured in hectares, square miles, and
square meters. A display monitor must be open and selected, but it is
not necessary to select or display a map in order to measure lengths
and areas. <span style="font-style: italic;">See d.measure.</span><br>
<h3>Geographical position</h3>



Interactive identification of geographical position in the coordinate
system of the current location.&nbsp;An x-terminal will open with
prompts for using the mouse and display the xy coordinates of at each
mouse click location.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.where.html">d.where</a></span>. 
<h3>Erase all layers and create a new group</h3>
Removes all layers in the layer tree and creates a new, empty group to which new layers can be added.<br>


<h3>Open an existing group file</h3>
Opens an previously saved group file, containing a set of display layers and their option settings.
<h3>Save layers to group file</h3>
Saves current set of layers and their options to a group file. 

<h3>Print map</h3>
Uses ps.map to print simple raster, vector, and text layers. Currently supported output formats are Postscript, PDF and PNG. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="ps.map.html">ps.map</a></span>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<h2>BUTTON FUNCTIONS (bottom row)</h2>



<h3>Add raster layer</h3>
Adds a raster map to the layer tree. Raster display options include:
displaying a selected subset of raster cells, defined by their cat
values; &nbsp;draping (or "fusing") a second map over the base map; and
displaying legends for the base map and draped map.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.rast.html">d.rast</a> and <a href="d.his.html">d.his</a> (for draping/fusing).</span>
<h3>Add RGB or HIS raster layer</h3>
Combines and displays three raster maps defined as red, green, and blue
channels; or combines and displays two or three raster maps defined as
hue, intensity, and (optionally) saturation channels. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.rgb.html">d.rgb</a> and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="d.his.html">d.his</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span>
<h3>Add raster legend</h3>
Adds a legend for a single raster map to the layer tree. Multiple options for formatting the legend are available. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.legend.html">d.legend</a>.</span>
<h3>Add vector layer</h3>
Adds a vector map to the layer tree. A large number of options are
available for displaying the vector map, including: outline and fill
color, icon type and size for points, line widths for all vector types,
automatic labeling using an attribute column, querying cats or
attributes to limit vectors displayed, and restricting vector display
depending on region size. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.vect.html">d.vect</a>.</span><br>
<h3>Add thematic charts layer (for vector points)</h3>
Adds layer in which pie or bar charts can be automatically created at
vector point locations. Charts display values from&nbsp;selected
columns in the associated attribute table. Options include: chart type,
layer and attributes to chart, chart colors, and chart size (fixed or
based on attribute column). <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.vect.chart.html">d.vect.chart</a>.</span>
<h3>Add thematic map layer (for all vector types) </h3>



Adds layer for thematic display values from a numeric attribute column
associated with a vector map. Options include: thematic display type
(graduated colors or point sizes), methods for creating display
intervals, SQL query of attribute column to limit vector objects to
display, control of point icon types and sizes, control of thematic
color schemes, creation of legend for thematic map, and saving the
results of thematic mapping to a ps.map instructions file for later
printing. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.vect.thematic.html">d.vect.thematic</a>.</span><br>
<h3>Add vector labels layer (from existing labels file)</h3>
Add text layer from a labels file for vector objects created with <a href="v.label.html">v.label</a>
command (accessed from the "vector-&gt;develop map-&gt;create text
label file for vector features" menu item). A labels file can also be
created with a text editor.
See <a href=d.labels.html>d.labels</a>. 


<h3>Add freetype text layer</h3>
Adds layer to display a line of freetype text. Options include: text
placement by coordinates (geographic or screen) or mouse; text
alignment and rotation, font and line spacing; and text size, bolding,
and color. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.text.freetype.html">d.text.freetype</a>.</span>
<h3>Add text layer</h3>
Adds layer to display a line of text using default GRASS font (selected with <a href="d.font.html" target="_blank">d.font</a>). Options include: text placement (screen coordinates); and text size, bolding, and color. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.text.html">d.text</a>.</span>
<h3>Add scalebar and north arrow layer</h3>
Adds layer to display a combined scalebar and north arrow. Options
include scalebar placement (using screen coordinates or a mouse),
scalebar format, and scalebar colors. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.barscale.html">d.barscale</a>.</span>
<h3>Overlay grids and lines</h3>
Adds layer to display regular grid (for all locations), or geodesic and
rhumblines (for latitude/longitude locations only). Grid options
include: grid and border colors, grid origin, and grid line spacing.
Geodesic and rhumbline options include: line color, and xy coordinates
(geographic) of line endpoints. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.grid.html">d.grid</a>, <a href="d.geodesic.html">d.geodesic</a>, and <a href="d.rhumbline.html">d.rhumbline</a>.</span>
<h3>Create or select display frames</h3>
Adds a layer to define (or select predefined) display frame. A display
frame is a rectangular subarea of a display monitor, within which maps
can be displayed. All layers following a frame layer will be displayed
within the frame defined in the frame layer&mdash;until a new frame
layer is added and new frame defined/selected. This allows a single
monitor window to be subdivided into multiple frames, each of which can
display different maps, legends, scalebars and north arrows, or other
layers. For example, the monitor could display a detail map and a small
frame could display an inset map. <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="d.frame.html">d.frame</a>.</span>
<h3>Add command layer</h3>
Adds a layer defined by a GRASS GIS command or command list. For a command list use the pipe symbol as
"|" as separator.

<p>

E.g.:  <em>d.rast soils | d.rast -o roads | d.vect streams col=blue</em>

</p>
<h3>Add group</h3>
Adds an empty layer group. Layers can then be added to the group.<br>
<h3>Duplicate selected layer or group</h3>
Adds a new layer that duplicates the selected layer.
<h3>Cut selected layer or group</h3>
Deletes the selected group or layer.
<h3>Digitize raster or vector maps</h3>
Starts the raster digitizing or vector digitizing module, depending on
whether a raster or vector map is selected. Raster digitizing always
creates a new map. Vector digitizing will either edit an existing map
(if an existing vector map is selected in the layer tree) or create a
new vector map (if the name of the new vector to be created is entered
in the 'vector name' field of the options panel for a vector map
layer). <span style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="r.digit.html">r.digit</a> and <a href="v.digit.html">v.digit</a></span>.<br>
