<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>g.mkfontcap</em> is a utilty to generate a GRASS font configuration file
("fontcap") containing details of the fonts available on the current system.
If <a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/">Freetype</a> is not installed,
the font list will be limited to the set of Hershey stroke fonts supplied
with GRASS. With Freetype enabled however, the module will recursively scan 
all files within a predefined hierarchy to find Freetype-compatible scalable
fonts. The list of directories scanned is currently:
<div class="code"><pre>
    /usr/lib/X11/fonts
    /usr/share/X11/fonts
    /usr/share/fonts
    /usr/local/share/fonts
    ${HOME}/Library/Fonts
    /Library/Fonts
    /System/Library/Fonts
    ${WINDIR}/Fonts
</pre></div>
<p>These correspond to directories where fonts can be found on some common
operating systems. Extra directories to search can easily by added using the
<b>extradirs</b> parameter, which accepts a comma-separated list. An extra
directory may optionally contain an environment variable <em>at the start</em> 
of the string, if enclosed in ${xxx} syntax (see examples above).

<p>The module will normally write to the standard fontcap file location,
<tt>$GISBASE/etc/fontcap</tt>. If the environment variable
<tt>GRASS_FONT_CAP</tt> is set, the output will instead be written 
to the file specified by that variable. This is useful if you don't have
permission to modify <tt>$GISBASE/etc/fontcap</tt>: in this case you can
use e.g.

<div class="code"><pre>
# use local file version instead of system copy
GRASS_FONT_CAP=$HOME/.gfontcap
export GRASS_FONT_CAP

g.mkfontcap
</pre></div>
<p>to create a personal copy and then to make GRASS use that file
instead of the system copy.

<p>The output list of fonts is sorted first by type (Stroke fonts first,
followed by Freetype) and within each type by the short name of the font.
