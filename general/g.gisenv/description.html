<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

When a user runs GRASS, certain variables are set
specifying the GRASS data base, location, mapset,
peripheral device drivers, etc., being used in the current
GRASS session.  These variable name settings are recognized
as long as the user is running a GRASS session.


<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

No prompts are given to the user when running
<em>g.gisenv</em>.  If run without arguments,
<em>g.gisenv</em> lists all of the user's current GRASS
variable settings.  Results are sent to standard output,
and may look like this:


<div class="code"><pre>
GISDBASE=/usr/grass5/data
LOCATION_NAME=spearfish
MAPSET=PERMANENT
</pre></div>

In this example, the full path name of the user's current
location (i.e., <kbd>$LOCATION_NAME</kbd>) is
<kbd>/usr/grass5/data/spearfish</kbd>, and the full path
name of the user's current mapset (i.e.,
<kbd>$MAPSET</kbd>) is
<kbd>/usr/grass5/data/spearfish/PERMANENT</kbd>.


<p>

If the user specifies a <em>variable_name</em> on the
command line (e.g., <b>g.gisenv MAPSET</b>), only the value
for that particular GRASS variable is output to standard
output.  Possible variable names depend on the user's
system, see <a href=variables.html>variables list</a> for details.


<p>

While other variables may be associated with each GRASS session
(e.g., DIGITIZER, PAINTER, DISPLAY, and other variables), those stated
below are essential.


<dl>
<dt><em>GISDBASE</em>

<dd>The <kbd>$GISDBASE</kbd> is a directory in which all
users' GRASS data are stored.  Within the

<kbd>$GISDBASE</kbd>, data are segregated into
subdirectories (called "locations") based on the map
coordinate system used and the geographic extent of the
data.  Each "location" directory itself contains
subdirectories called "mapsets"; each "mapset" stores "data
base elements" -- the directories (e.g., the
<kbd>cell</kbd>, <kbd>cellhd</kbd>, <kbd>dig</kbd>, etc.,
directories) in which GRASS data files are actually
stored.

<dt><em>LOCATION_NAME</em>

<dd>The user must choose to work with the data under a single
GRASS location within any given GRASS session; this
location is then called the <em>current GRASS
location</em>, and is specified by the variable
<kbd>$LOCATION_NAME</kbd>.  The <kbd>$LOCATION_NAME</kbd>

is the GRASS data base location whose data will be affected
by any GRASS commands issued during the user's current
GRASS session, and is a subdirectory of the current
<kbd>$GISDBASE</kbd>.  Each "location" directory can
contain multiple "mapset" directories (including the
special mapset <kbd>PERMANENT</kbd>).  Maps stored under
the same GRASS <kbd>LOCATION_NAME</kbd> (and/or within the
same <kbd>MAPSET</kbd>) must use the same coordinate system
and typically fall within the boundaries of the same
geographic region (aka, "location").


<dt><em>MAPSET</em>

<dd>Each "mapset" contains a set of maps relevant to the
<kbd>LOCATION_NAME</kbd> directory in which it appears.
Each <kbd>LOCATION_NAME</kbd> can contain multiple
mapsets.  (Mapsets which fall under the same

<kbd>LOCATION_NAME</kbd> all contain data geographically
relevant to the <kbd>LOCATION_NAME</kbd>, and all store
data in the same map coordinate system.  Frequently, maps
are placed into different mapsets to distinguish file
ownership -- e.g., each user might have his own mapset,
storing any maps that he has created and/or are relevant to
his work.) During each GRASS session, the user must choose
one mapset to be the <em>current mapset</em>;  the current
mapset setting is given by <kbd>$MAPSET</kbd>, and is a
subdirectory of <kbd>$LOCATION_NAME</kbd>.  During a single
GRASS session, the user can use available data in any of
the mapsets stored under the current
<kbd>LOCATION_NAME</kbd> directory that are in the user's
mapset search path and accessible by the user.  However,
within a single GRASS session, the user only has
<em>write</em> access to data stored under the <em>current
mapset</em> (specified by the variable

<kbd>$MAPSET</kbd>).


<p>

Each "mapset" stores GRASS data base elements (i.e., the
directories in which GRASS data files are stored).  Any
maps created or modified by the user in the current GRASS
session will be stored here.  The <kbd>MAPSET</kbd>
directory <kbd>PERMANENT</kbd> is generally reserved for
the set of maps that form the base set for all users
working under each <kbd>LOCATION_NAME</kbd>.

</dl>

Once within a GRASS session, GRASS users have access only
to the data under a single GRASS data base directory (the
<em>current GRASS data base</em>, specified by the variable

<kbd>$GISDBASE</kbd>), and to a single GRASS location
directory (the <em>current location</em>, specified by the
variable <kbd>$LOCATION_NAME</kbd>).  Within a single
session, the user may only <em>modify</em> the data in the
<em>current mapset</em> (specified by the variable
<kbd>$MAPSET</kbd>), but may <em>use</em> data available
under other mapsets under the same

<kbd>LOCATION_NAME</kbd>.


<p>

All of these names must be legal names on the user's
current system.  For UNIX users, names less than 14
characters and containing no non-printing or space codes
are permissible.  Examples of permissible names include:
<em>one</em>, <em>mymap</em>, <em>VeGe_map</em>, and
<em>1_for_me</em>.  The underscore character can safely be
used in place of a blank for multiple-word names.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The output from

<em>g.gisenv</em>

when invoked without arguments is directly usable by /bin/sh.
The following command will cast each variable into the UNIX environment:
<p>

<div class="code"><pre>
<b>eval `g.gisenv`</b>
</pre></div>

<p>
This works only for <em>/bin/sh</em>. The format of the
output is not compatible with other UNIX shells.

<h3>GRASS Debugging:</h3>

To print debugging messages, the variable DEBUG must be set to level equal or 
greater than 0:
<P>
<div class="code"><pre>
<TT>g.gisenv set="DEBUG=3"</TT>
</pre></div>
<P>

Levels: (recommended levels)
<ul>
<li> 0 - silence
<li>  1 - message is printed once or few times per module
<li>  3 - each row (raster) or line (vector)
<li>  5 - each cell (raster) or point (vector)
</ul>

To disable debugging messages, DEBUG must be set back to 0:
<P>
<div class="code"><pre>
<TT>g.gisenv set="DEBUG=0"</TT>
</pre></div>
<P>
