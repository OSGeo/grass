<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>g.region</em> module allows the user to manage the
settings of the current geographic region.  These regional
boundaries can be set by the user directly and/or set from
a region definition file (stored under the
<kbd>windows</kbd> directory in the user's current
mapset).  The user can create, modify, and store as many
geographic region definitions as desired for any given
mapset.  However, only one of these geographic region
definitions will be current at any given moment, for a
specified mapset;  i.e., GRASS programs that respect the
geographic region settings will use the current geographic
region settings.


<h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>Region:</b>

<dd>In GRASS, a <em>region</em> refers to a geographic area
with some defined boundaries, based on a specific map
coordinate system and map projection.  Each region also has
associated with it the specific east-west and north-south
resolutions of its smallest units (rectangular units called
"cells").

<p>
The region's boundaries are given as the northernmost,
southernmost, easternmost, and westernmost points that
define its extent (cell edges).  The north and south boundaries
are commonly called <em>northings</em>, while the east and west
boundaries are called <em>eastings</em>.

<p>
The region's cell resolution defines the size of the
smallest piece of data recognized (imported, analyzed,
displayed, stored, etc.) by GRASS modules affected by the
current region settings. The north-south and east-west cell
resolutions need not be the same, thus allowing non-square
data cells to exist.

<p>Typically all raster and display modules are affected by the current
region settings, but not vector modules.
Some special modules diverge from this rule, for example raster import
modules and <em>v.in.region</em>.


<dt><b>Default Region:</b>

<dd>Each GRASS LOCATION has a fixed
geographic region, called the default geographic region
(stored in the region file <kbd>DEFAULT_WIND</kbd> under
the special mapset <kbd>PERMANENT</kbd>), that defines the
extent of the data base.  While this provides a starting
point for defining new geographic regions, user-defined
geographic regions need not fall within this geographic
region. The current region can be reset to the default region
with the <b>-d</b> flag. The default region is initially set
when the location is first created and can be reset using the
<b>-s</b> flag.

<dt><b>Current Region:</b>

<dd>Each mapset has a current geographic region.  This
region defines the geographic area in which all GRASS
displays and raster analyses will be done. Raster data will be
resampled, if necessary, to meet the cell resolutions of
the current geographic region setting.

<dt><b>Saved Regions:</b>

<dd>Each GRASS MAPSET may contain any number of
pre-defined, and named, geographic regions.  These region
definitions are stored in the user's current mapset
location under the <kbd>windows</kbd> directory (also
referred to as the user's saved region definitions).
Any of these pre-defined geographic regions
may be selected, by name, to become the current geographic
region.  Users may also access saved region definitions
stored under other mapsets in the current location, if
these mapsets are included in the user's mapset search
path or the '@' operator is used (<tt>region_name@mapset</tt>).
</dl>


<h2>NOTES</h2>

After all updates have been applied, the current region's
southern and western boundaries are (silently) adjusted so
that the north/south distance is a multiple of the
north/south resolution and that the east/west distance is a
multiple of the east/west resolution.

<p>With the <b>-a</b> flag all four boundaries are adjusted 
to be even multiples of the resolution, aligning the region to the
resolution supplied by the user. The default is to
align the region resolution to match the region boundaries.

<p>The <b>-m</b> flag will report the region resolution in meters. The
resolution is calculated by averaging the resolution at the region
boundaries. This resolution is calculated by dividing the geodesic 
distance in meters at the boundary by the number of rows or columns.
For example the east / west resolution (ewres) is determined from an 
average of the geodesic distances at the North and South boundaries 
divided by the number of columns.
<!-- add'l info. include?
Print the region resolution in meters (from geodesic). With no other
flags the default output format is shell stype (-g). The region resolution
represents the center of the map. The resolutions are calculated at the four
outside edges, then the two NS edges are averaged and the two EW edges are
averaged, the results finally printed.
-->


<p>The <b>-p</b> (or <b>-g</b>) option is recognized
last.  This means that all changes are applied to the
region settings before printing occurs.
<p>The <b>-g</b> flag prints the current region settings in shell script style.
This format can be given back to <em>g.region</em> on its command line.
This may also be used to save region settings as shell environment variables
with the UNIX eval command, "<tt>eval `g.region -g`</tt>".


<h3>Additional parameter information:</h3>

<dl>

<dt><b>zoom=</b><em>name</em>
<dd>Shrink current region settings to the smallest region
encompassing all non-NULL data in the named raster map
layer that fall inside the user's current region. In this
way you can tightly zoom in on isolated clumps within a
bigger map.
<p>If the user also includes the <b>raster=</b><em>name</em>
option on the command line, <b>zoom=</b><em>name</em> will
set the current region settings to the smallest region
encompassing all non-NULL data in the named <b>zoom</b> map
that fall inside the region stated in the cell header for
the named <b>raster</b> map.


<dt><b>align=</b><em>name</em> 

<dd>Set the current resolution equal to that of the named
raster map, and align the current region to a row and
column edge in the named map.  Alignment only moves the
existing region edges outward to the edges of the next
nearest cell in the named raster map - not to the named
map's edges.  To perform the latter function, use the
<b>raster=</b><em>name</em> option.
</dl>

<p>
<dt><span class="code"><tt>

</pre></div>

<p>
<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region -l

</pre></div>

<p>
<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region -pm
</tt></span>

<dd> This will print the current region in the format
 (latitude-longitude location):

<div class="code"><pre>

cols:       4800
</pre></div>
Note that the resolution is here reported in meters, not decimal degrees.
</dl>

<h3>Changing extent and raster resolution using values</h3>
<dl>
<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region n=7360100 e=699000
</tt></span>

<dd> will reset the northing and easting for the current
region, but leave the south edge, west edge, and the region
cell resolutions unchanged.

<p>
<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region n=51:36:05N e=10:10:05E s=51:29:55N w=9:59:55E res=0:00:01
</tt></span>

<dd> will reset the northing, easting, southing, westing and resolution
for the current region, here in DMS latitude-longitude style
(decimal degrees and degrees with decimal minutes can also be used).

<p>
<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region -dp s=698000
</tt></span>

<dd> will set the current region from the default region
for the GRASS data base location, reset the south edge to
698000, and then print the result.

<p>
<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region n=n+1000 w=w-500
</tt></span>

<dd> The n=<em>value</em> may also be specified as a
function of its current value:  n=n+<em>value</em>
increases the current northing, while n=n-<em>value</em>
decreases it.  This is also true for s=<em>value</em>,
e=<em>value</em>, and w=<em>value</em>.  In this example
the current region's northern boundary is extended by 1000
units and the current region's western boundary is
decreased by 500 units.

<p>
<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region n=s+1000 e=w+1000
</tt></span>

<dd> This form allows the user to set the region boundary
values relative to one another.  Here, the northern
boundary coordinate is set equal to 1000 units larger than
the southern boundary's coordinate value, and the eastern
boundary's coordinate value is set equal to 1000 units
larger than the western boundary's coordinate value.  The
corresponding forms s=n-<em>value</em> and

<p>
w=e-<em>value</em> may be used to set the values of the
region's southern and western boundaries, relative to the
northern and eastern boundary values.
</dl>

<h3>Changing extent and raster resolution using maps</h3>
<dl>
<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region raster=soils
</tt></span>

<dd> This form will make the current region settings
exactly the same as those given in the cell header file for
the raster map layer <em>soils</em>.

<p>

<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region raster=soils zoom=soils
</tt></span>

<dd> This form will first look up the cell header file for
the raster map layer <em>soils</em>, use this as the
current region setting, and then shrink the region down to
the smallest region which still encompasses all non-NULL
data in the map layer <em>soils</em>.  Note that if the
parameter <em>raster=soils</em> were not specified, the
zoom would shrink to encompass all non-NULL data values in
the soils map that were located within the <i>current region</i>
settings.

<p>

<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region -up raster=soils
</tt></span>

<dd> The <b>-u</b> option suppresses the re-setting of the
current region definition.  This can be useful when it is
desired to only extract region information.  In this case,
the cell header file for the soils map layer is printed
without changing the current region settings.

<p>
<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region -up zoom=soils save=soils
</tt></span>

<dd> This will zoom into the smallest region which
encompasses all non-NULL soils data values, and save the
new region settings in a file to be called <em>soils</em>
and stored under the <kbd>windows</kbd> directory in the
user's current mapset.  The current region settings are not
changed.
</dl>

<h3>Changing extent and raster resolution in 3D</h3>
<dl>
<dt><span class="code"><tt>
g.region b=0 t=3000 tbres=200 res3=100
g.region -p3
</tt></span>

<dd> This will define the 3D region for voxel computations.
In this example a volume with bottom (0m) to top (3000m)
at horizontal resolution (100m) and vertical resolution (200m)
is defined.
</dl>

<h3>Using g.region in a shell in combination with OGR</h3>

<!-- why not 'v.in.ogr spatial=' ?? -->
Extracting a spatial subset of the external vector map
<tt>soils.shp</tt> into new external vector map <tt>soils_cut.shp</tt>
using the OGR <em>ogr2ogr</em> tool:<br>

<div class="code"><pre>
eval `g.region -g`
ogr2ogr -spat $w $s $e $n soils_cut.shp soils.shp
</pre></div>

This requires that the location/SHAPE file projection match.

<h3>Using g.region in a shell in combination with GDAL</h3>

Extracting a spatial subset of the external raster map
<tt>p016r035_7t20020524_z17_nn30.tif</tt> into new external raster
map <tt>p016r035_7t20020524_nc_spm_wake_nn30.tif</tt> using the GDAL
<em>gdalwarp</em> tool:<br>

<div class="code"><pre>
eval `g.region -g`
gdalwarp -t_srs "`g.proj -wf`" -te $w $s $e $n \
         p016r035_7t20020524_z17_nn30.tif \
         p016r035_7t20020524_nc_spm_wake_nn30.tif
</pre></div>

Here the input raster map does not have to match the location
projection since it is reprojected on the fly.
