<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

For basic information about GRASS <em>subproject</em>, <em>project</em>
and <em>data base</em> refer to <a href="helptext.html">GRASS
Quickstart</a>.

<p>
A <em>subproject</em> holds a distinct set of data layers, each relevant
to the same (or a subset of the same) geographic region, and each
drawn in the same map coordinate system.  At the outset of every GRASS
session, the user identifies a GRASS data base, project, and subproject
that are to be the user's <em>current data base</em>, <em>current
project</em>, and <em>current subproject</em> for the duration of the
session; any maps created by the user during the session will be
stored under the <em>current subproject</em> set at the session's outset
(see <em><a href="g.subproject.html">g.subproject</a></em> [without an "s"]
and <em><a href="g.gisenv.html">g.gisenv</a></em> for changing the
subproject with a session).

<p>
The user can add, modify, and delete data layers that exist under
their <em>current subproject</em>. Although the user can
also <em>access</em> (i.e., use) data that are stored under
<em>other</em> subprojects in the same GRASS project using the
<tt>mapname@subprojectname</tt> notation or subproject search path, the user
can only make permanent changes (create or modify data)
located in the <em>current subproject</em>.  The user's
<em>subproject search path</em> lists the order in which other subprojects in
the same GRASS project can be searched and their data accessed by the
user. The user can modify the listing and order in which these subprojects
are accessed by modifying the subproject search path; this can be done
using the <em>g.subprojects</em> command. This program allows the user to
use other's relevant map data without altering the original data
layer, and without taking up disk space with a copy of the original
map. The <tt>mapname@subprojectname</tt> notation may be used irrespective
of the subproject search path, i.e., any map found in another subproject with
sufficient <em><a href="g.access.html">g.access</a></em> privileges
may be called in such a manner.

<p>
<em>g.subprojects</em> shows the user available subprojects under the current
GRASS project, lists subprojects to which the user currently has access,
and lists the order in which accessible subprojects will be accessed by
GRASS programs searching for data files.  The user is then given the
opportunity to add or delete subproject names from the search path, or
modify the order in which subprojects will be accessed.

<p>
When the user specifies the name of a data base element file (e.g., a
particular vector map, raster map, <a href="i.group.html">imagery</a>
group file, etc.) to a GRASS program, the program searches for the
named file under each of the subprojects listed in the user's subproject
search path in the order listed there until the program finds a file
of the given name. Users can also specify a file by its subproject, to
make explicit the subproject from which the file is to be drawn; e.g., the
command:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.copy raster=soils@PERMANENT,my_soils
</pre></div>

ensures that a new file named <tt>my_soils</tt> is to be a copy of
the file <tt>soils</tt> from the subproject PERMANENT.

<p>
In each project there is the special subproject <b>PERMANENT</b> included
in the subproject search path, as this subproject typically contains base maps
relevant to many applications. Often, other subprojects which contain sets
of interpreted maps will be likewise included in the user's subproject search path.
Suppose, for example, that the subproject <em>Soil_Maps</em> contains
interpreted soils map layers to which the user wants access. The
subproject <em>Soil_Maps</em> should then be included in the user's
<em>search path</em> variable.

<p>
The <em>subproject search path</em> is saved as part of the current
subproject. When the user works with that subproject in subsequent GRASS
sessions, the previously saved subproject search path will be used (and
will continue to be used until it is modified by the user
with <em>g.subprojects</em>).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

By default <em>g.subprojects</em> adds to the current <em>subproject search
path</em> subprojects named by <b>subproject</b> option. Alternatively subprojects
can be removed (<b>operation=remove</b>) from the search path or
defined by <b>operation=set</b>.

<p>
Users can restrict others' access to their subproject files through use
of <em><a href="g.access.html">g.access</a></em>. Subprojects to which
access is restricted can still be listed in another's subproject search
path; however, access to these subprojects will remain restricted.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Selecting subprojects with the graphical subproject manager</h3>

Using the <b>-s</b> flag, a convenient graphical subproject manager can
be opened to select and deselect other subprojects (the actual subproject and
the PERMANENT subproject are always selected):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.subprojects -s
</pre></div>

<center>
<img src="g_subprojects_gui.png"><br>
</center>


<h3>Print available subprojects</h3>
All available subprojects in the current project can be printed out by

<div class="code"><pre>
g.subprojects -l

Available subprojects:
PERMANENT user1 user2
</pre></div>

<h3>Add new subproject</h3>

Add subproject 'user2' to the current subproject search path

<div class="code"><pre>
g.subprojects subproject=user2 operation=add
</pre></div>

The current subproject search path is changed accordingly

<div class="code"><pre>
g.subprojects -p

Accessible subprojects:
user1 user2
</pre></div>

<h3>Overwrite current search path</h3>

Overwrite current search path

<div class="code"><pre>
g.subprojects subproject=user1,PERMANENT operation=set
</pre></div>

<h3>Using shortcuts for search path</h3>

The current subproject can be defined by a shortcut &quot;.&quot; (dot)

<div class="code"><pre>
g.subprojects subproject=.,PERMANENT operation=set
</pre></div>

<i>Note:</i> The current subproject will be always included in the search
path on the first position even if you change its position or omit the
current subproject from the <b>subproject</b> option.

<div class="code"><pre>
g.subprojects -p

Accessible subprojects:
user1 PERMANENT
</pre></div>
