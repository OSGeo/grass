<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This program allows the user to control access to the
current subproject.  Normally, any user can read data from any
GRASS subproject. But sometimes it is desirable to prohibit
access to certain sensitive data. The <em>g.access</em>
command allows a user to restrict read and execute access
to the current subproject (see UNIX <em>chmod</em> command).
<em>g.access</em> will not modify write access to the
current subproject.

<p>
The user may, for example, allow only users in the same
UNIX group to read data files in the subproject, or restrict
the subproject to personal use only.

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<p> Under GRASS, access to the subproject PERMANENT must be open to
all users.  This is because GRASS looks for the user's default geographic
region definition settings and the project TITLE in files that are stored
under the PERMANENT subproject directory.  The <em>g.access</em> command,
therefore, will not allow you to restrict access to the PERMANENT subproject.

<p>The <em><a href="g.subprojects.html">g.subprojects</a></em> command isn't smart
enough to tell if access to a specified subproject is restricted, and the user
is therefore allowed to include the names of restricted subprojects in his
search path.  However, the data in a restricted subproject is still protected;
any attempts to look for or use data in a restricted subproject will fail.  The
user will simply not see any data listed for a restricted subproject.

<p>UNIX filesystem access controls and <em>g.access</em> actions are not 
supported by MS-Windows.
