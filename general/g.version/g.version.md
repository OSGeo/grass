## DESCRIPTION

*g.version* prints to standard output the GRASS version number, date,
the GRASS GIS copyright (**-c** flag), and GRASS build information
(**-b** flag).

## NOTES

This program requires no command line arguments; the user simply types
*g.version* on the command line to see the version number and date of
the GRASS GIS software currently being run by the user.

Information about GRASS GIS core [GIS
Library](https://grass.osgeo.org/programming8/gislib.html) can be
printed by **-r** flag.

Version numbers of additional libraries like [PROJ](https://proj.org/),
[GDAL/OGR](https://gdal.org/) or [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos) are
printed by **-e** flag.

See also function `version()` from [Python Scripting
Library](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_Python_Scripting_Library).

```sh
import grass.script as gcore

print gcore.version()
```

Note: if `revision=exported` is reported instead of the git hash then
the `git` program was not available during compilation of GRASS GIS and
the source code did not contain the `.git/` subdirectory (requires e.g.
to `git clone` the GRASS GIS [software
repository](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/).)
