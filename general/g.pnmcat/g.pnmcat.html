<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<p>
Concatenate PNM tiles into a single image.
<p>
This module is for use by NVIZ' "Maximum resolution PPM" option.
<p>
It concatenates a grid of &lt;rows&gt; x &lt;cols&gt; binary PPM
images into a single image. The images must all be named
&lt;base&gt;_&lt;row&gt;_&lt;col&gt;.ppm, where &lt;row&gt; and
&lt;col&gt; start from one, with row one being the bottom row, and
where &lt;base&gt; is the value of the <em>base=</em> option.
<p>
All images within a row must have the same height, and the widths must
sum to the value of the <em>width=</em> option. The heights of the individual
rows must sum to the value of the <em>height=</em> option. All images must be
in "P6" (binary PPM) format.
