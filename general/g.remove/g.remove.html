<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>g.remove</em> removes data files matching a pattern given by wildcards or
POSIX Extended Regular Expressions. If the <b>-f</b> force flag is not given
then nothing is removed, instead the list of selected file names is printed to
<tt>stdout</tt> as a preview of the files to be deleted.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Delete <tt>map1</tt> and <tt>map2</tt> raster maps in the current mapset:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.remove -f type=raster name=tmp1,tmp2
</pre></div>

Delete all raster and vector maps starting with "<tt>tmp_</tt>" in the current
mapset:
<div class="code"><pre>
# show matching raster and vector maps but do not delete yet (as verification)
g.remove type=raster,vector pattern="tmp_*"

# actually delete the matching raster and vector maps
g.remove -f type=raster,vector pattern="tmp_*"
</pre></div>

Delete all vector maps starting with "<tt>stream_</tt>" in the current mapset,
but exclude those ending with "<tt>_final</tt>":
<div class="code"><pre>
g.remove -f type=vector pattern="stream_*" exclude="*_final"
</pre></div>
