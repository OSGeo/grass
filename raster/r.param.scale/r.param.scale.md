## DESCRIPTION

*r.param.scale* extracts terrain parameters from a digital elevation
model. Uses a multi-scale approach by fitting a bivariate quadratic
polynomial to a given window size using least squares.

The module calculates the following parameters (terminology is from
Wood, 1996 with related terminology used in other GRASS modules listed
in brackets):

- *elev*: Generalised elevation value (for resampling purposes at
  different scale)
- *slope*: Magnitude of maximum gradient (steepest slope angle)
- *aspect*: Direction of maximum gradient (steepest slope direction=flow
  direction)
- *profc*: profile curvature (curvature intersecting with the plane
  defined by *Z* axis and maximum gradient direction). Positive values
  describe convex profile curvature, negative values concave profile
  curvature.
- *planc*: plan curvature (horizontal curvature, intersecting with the
  *XY* plane)
- *longc*: longitudinal curvature (profile curvature intersecting with
  the plane defined by the surface normal and maximum gradient
  direction)
- *crosc*: cross-sectional curvature (tangential curvature intersecting
  with the plane defined by the surface normal and a tangent to the
  contour - perpendicular to maximum gradient direction)
- *maxic*: maximum curvature (can be in any direction)
- *minic*: minimum curvature (in direction perpendicular to the
  direction of of maximum curvature)
- *feature*: Morphometric features: peaks, ridges, passes, channels,
  pits and planes

## NOTES

In *r.param.scale* the direction of maximum gradient (considered
downslope) is stored as (West is 0 degree, East is +/- 180 degree):

- 0..+180 degree from West to North to East
- 0..-180 degree from West to South to East

Note that the aspect map is calculated differently from
*[r.slope.aspect](r.slope.aspect.md)*.

## EXAMPLE

The next commands will create a geomorphological map of the Spearfish
sample dataset region:

```sh
g.region raster=elevation.10m -p
r.param.scale in=elevation.10m output=morphology method=feature size=9
```

in the Spearfish (SD) area*

## TODO

Fix bug when \`constrain through central cell' option selected. Create
color tables for all output files (presently only on features).
