<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.series</em> makes each output cell value a function of the values
assigned to the corresponding cells in the input raster map layers.
Following methods are available:

<ul> 
 <li>average: average value
 <li>count: count of non-NULL cells
 <li>median: median value
 <li>mode: most frequently occuring value
 <li>minimum: lowest value
 <li>maximum: highest value
 <li>range: range of values (max - min)
 <li>stddev: standard deviation
 <li>sum: sum of values
 <li>variance: statistical variance
 <li>diversity: number of different values
 <li>slope: linear regression slope
 <li>offset: linear regression offset
 <li>detcoeff: linear regression coefficient of determination
 <li>tvalue: linear regression t-value
 <li>min_raster: raster map number with the minimum time-series value
 <li>max_raster: raster map number with the maximum time-series value
 </ul> 

<h2>NOTES</h2>

With <em>-n</em> flag, any cell for which any of the corresponding input cells are
NULL is automatically set to NULL (NULL propagation). The aggregate function is not
called, so all methods behave this way with respect to the <em>-n</em> flag.
<p>Without <em>-n</em> flag, the complete list of inputs for each cell (including
NULLs) is passed to the aggregate function. Individual aggregates can
handle data as they choose. Mostly, they just compute the aggregate
over the non-NULL values, producing a NULL result only if all inputs
are NULL.
<p>The <em>min_raster</em> and <em>max_raster</em> methods generate a map with the
number of the raster map that holds the minimum/maximum value of the
time-series. The numbering starts at <em>0</em> up to <em>n</em> for the
first and the last raster listed in <em>input=</em>, respectively. 
<p>If the <em>range=</em> option is given, any values which fall outside
that range will be treated as if they were NULL.
The <em>range</em> parameter can be set to <em>low,high</em> thresholds:
values outside of this range are treated as NULL (i.e., they will be
ignored by most aggregates, or will cause the result to be NULL if -n is given).
The <em>low,high</em> thresholds are floating point, so use <em>-inf</em> or
<em>inf</em> for a single threshold (e.g., <em>range=0,inf</em> to ignore
negative values, or <em>range=-inf,-200.4</em> to ignore values above -200.4).
<p>Linear regression (slope, offset, coefficient of determination, t-value) assumes equal time intervals.
If the data have irregular time intervals, NULL raster maps can be inserted into time series
to make time intervals equal (see example).
<p>Number of raster maps to be processed is given by the limit of the
operating system. For example, both the hard and soft limits are
typically 1024. The soft limit can be changed with e.g. <tt>ulimit -n
1500</tt> (UNIX-based operating systems) but not higher than the hard
limit. If it is too low, you can as superuser add an entry in

<div class="code"><pre>
/etc/security/limits.conf
# &lt;domain&gt;      &lt;type&gt;  &lt;item&gt;         &lt;value&gt;
your_username  hard    nofile          1500
</pre></div>

This would raise the hard limit to 1500 file. Be warned that more
files open need more RAM.

For each map a weighting factor can be specified using the <em>weights</em> option.
Using weights can be meaningful when computing sum or average of maps with different 
temporal extent. The default weight is 1.0. The number of weights must be identical 
with the number of input maps and must have the same order. Weights can also be specified in the
input file.

<p>Use the <em>file</em> option to analyze large amount of raster maps without 
hitting open files limit and the size limit of command line arguments. 
The computation is slower than the <em>input</em> option method. 
For every sinlge row in the output map(s) 
all input maps are opened and closed. The amount of RAM will rise linear
with the number of specified input maps. The input and file options are mutually exclusive.
Input is a text file with a new line separated list of raster map names and optional weights.
As separator between the map name and the weight the charachter | must be used.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Using <em>r.series</em> with wildcards:
<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
r.series input="`g.mlist pattern='insitu_data.*' sep=,`" \
         output=insitu_data.stddev method=stddev
</pre></div>
<p>Note the <em>g.mlist</em> script also supports regular expressions for
selecting map names.
<p>Using <em>r.series</em> with NULL raster maps:
<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
r.mapcalc "dummy = null()"
r.series in=map2001,map2002,dummy,dummy,map2005,map2006,dummy,map2008 \
         out=res_slope,res_offset,res_coeff meth=slope,offset,detcoeff
</pre></div>

<p>Example for multiple aggregates to be computed in one run (3 resulting aggregates
from two input maps):
<div class="code"><pre>
r.series in=one,two out=result_avg,res_slope,result_count meth=sum,slope,count
</pre></div>

<p>Example to use the file option of r.series:
<div class="code"><pre>
cat > input.txt &lt;&lt; EOF
map1
map2
map3
EOF

r.series file=input.txt out=result_sum meth=sum
</pre></div>

<p>Example to use the file option of r.series including weights. The weight 0.75
should be assigned to map2. As the other maps do not have weights we can leave it out:
<div class="code"><pre>
cat > input.txt &lt;&lt; EOF
map1
map2|0.75
map3
EOF

r.series file=input.txt out=result_sum meth=sum
</pre></div>

<p>
Example for counting the number of days above a certain temperature using 
daily average maps ('???' as DOY wildcard):
<div class="code"><pre>
r.series input=`g.mlist rast pat="temp_2003_???_avg" sep=,` \
         output=temp_2003_days_over_25deg range=25.0,100.0 method=count
</pre></div>
