<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.compress</em> can be used to compress or decompress raster maps. 
Additionally, it prints information about the compression method and 
data type of the input raster map(s).

<p>
All raster maps (those imported for the first time and those newly 
generated) are compressed by default using the ZSTD compression 
method if available, otherwise ZLIB compression is used (see below). 
Related no data files (i.e.: NULL files), if present, are compressed by 
default unless a specific environment variable is set to explicitly 
disable NULL file compression (<tt>GRASS_COMPRESS_NULLS</tt>, see 
below).

<p>
During compression or re-compression, <em>r.compress</em> compresses 
raster maps using the method specified by means of the environment 
variable <tt>GRASS_COMPRESSOR</tt>. The default compression method is 
ZSTD if available, otherwise ZLIB's "deflate" algorithm (LZ77-based). 
Raster maps that contain very little information (such as boundary, 
geology, soils and land use maps) can be greatly reduced in size. Some 
raster maps are shrunk to roughly 1% of their original sizes. 
All newly generated raster maps are automatically stored as compressed
data with varying methods depending on the raster format (i.e.,
CELL: integer; FCELL: single precision; DCELL: double precision; see
below). All GRASS GIS modules are able to read both compressed and
uncompressed raster maps.

<!-- too old and RLE only example
<p>
As an example, the Spearfish data base raster map layer
<em>owner</em> was originally a size of 26600 bytes.  After
it was RLE compressed, the raster map became only 1249 bytes
(25351 bytes smaller).
-->

<p>
Raster maps that are already compressed might be compressed again, 
either by setting a different method with <tt>GRASS_COMPRESSOR</tt> 
(supported methods: RLE, ZLIB, LZ4, BZIP2, ZSTD) or, for the case of 
ZLIB compression, by changing the compression level with the 
environment variable <tt>GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL</tt>.

<p>
Compressed raster maps may be decompressed using <em>r.compress</em> 
with the <b>-u</b> flag. If a raster map was already decompressed and 
the <b>-u</b> flag is set, the module simply informs the user that the 
map is already decompressed and exits.

<p>
Information about the compression method and data type of the input 
raster map(s) can be printed in shell style with the <b>-g</b> flag. In 
this case, the module prints to <tt>stdout</tt> one line per input map 
with the fields &quot;input map name&quot;, &quot;data type&quot;, 
&quot;name of data compression method&quot;, &quot;NULL file 
compression&quot; separated by the pipe character. NULL file 
compression is indicated with &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;. 

<h3>TERMINOLOGY</h3>

<ul>
<li> INTEGER map (CELL data type): a raster map of INTEGER type (whole
  numbers only)</li>
<li> FLOAT map (FCELL data type): a raster map of FLOAT type (4 bytes,
  7-9 digits precision)</li>
<li> DOUBLE map (DCELL data type): a raster map of DOUBLE type (8 bytes,
  15-17 digits precision)</li>
<li> NULL: represents "no data" in raster maps; to be distinguished from
  0 (zero) data value</li>
</ul>

<h3>OVERVIEW OF AVAILABLE COMPRESSION ALGORITHMS</h3>

The following compression methods are available (set by
<tt>export GRASS_COMPRESSOR=<em>method</em></tt>):

<ul>
<li><tt>NONE</tt> (uncompressed)</li>
<li><tt>RLE</tt>  (generic Run-Length Encoding of single bytes; deprecated)</li>
<li><tt>ZLIB</tt> (DEFLATE, good speed and compression)
<ul>
<li>with zlib compression levels (<tt>export GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL=X</tt>): -1..9
   (-1 is default which corresponds to ZLIB level 6)</li>
<li>note: <tt>export GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL=0</tt> is equal to copying the data
    as-is from source to destination</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><tt>LZ4</tt>  (fastest, low compression)</li>
<li><tt>BZIP2</tt> (slowest, high compression)</li>
<li><tt>ZSTD</tt> (compared to ZLIB, faster and higher compression, 
much faster decompression - <b>default compression</b>)</li>
</ul>

Important: the NULL file compression can be turned off with 
<tt>export GRASS_COMPRESS_NULLS=0</tt>. Raster maps with NULL file 
compression can only be opened with GRASS GIS 7.2.0 or later. NULL file 
compression for a particular raster map can be managed with <b>r.null -z</b>.
The NULL file compression is using the LZ4 method as being the best compromise
between speed and compression rate.

<h3>COMPRESSION ALGORITHM DETAILS</h3>
<!-- keep in sync with raster/rasterintro.html -->

All GRASS GIS raster map types are by default ZSTD compressed if 
available, otherwise ZLIB compressed. Through the environment variable 
<tt>GRASS_COMPRESSOR</tt> the compression method can be set to RLE, 
ZLIB, LZ4, BZIP2, or ZSTD.
<p>
Integer (CELL type) raster maps can be compressed with RLE if
the environment variable <tt>GRASS_COMPRESSOR</tt> exists and is set to 
RLE. However, this is not recommended.
<p>
Floating point (FCELL, DCELL) raster maps never use RLE compression;
they are either compressed with ZLIB, LZ4, BZIP2, ZSTD or are uncompressed.

<!-- BTW, why not having an option "method" and another one "level"
     instead of the environment variables? Is it too complicated?
     
     Where should these options "method" and "level" be available/
     exposed to the user? Surely not in every module creating a raster map.
-->
<dl>
<dt><strong>RLE</strong></dt>
<dd><b>DEPRECATED</b> Run-Length Encoding, poor compression ratio but 
fast. It is kept for backwards compatibility to read raster maps 
created with GRASS 6. It is only used for raster maps of type CELL.
FCELL and DCELL maps are never and have never been compressed with RLE.
</dd>
<dt><strong>ZLIB</strong></dt>
<dd>ZLIB's deflate is the default compression method for all raster 
maps, if ZSTD is not available. GRASS GIS 7 uses by default 1 as ZLIB 
compression level which is the best compromise between speed and 
compression ratio, also when compared to other available compression 
methods. Valid levels are in the range [1, 9] and can be set with the 
environment variable <tt>GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL</tt>.</dd>
<dt><strong>LZ4</strong></dt>
<dd>LZ4 is a very fast compression method, about as fast as no 
compression. Decompression is also very fast. The compression ratio is 
generally higher than for RLE but worse than for ZLIB. LZ4 is 
recommended if disk space is not a limiting factor.</dd>
<dt><strong>BZIP2</strong></dt>
<dd>BZIP2 can provide compression ratios much higher than the other 
methods, but only for large raster maps (&gt; 10000 columns). For large 
raster maps, disk space consumption can be reduced by 30 - 50% when 
using BZIP2 instead of ZLIB's deflate. BZIP2 is the slowest compression 
and decompression method. However, if reading from / writing to a 
storage device is the limiting factor, BZIP2 compression can speed up 
raster map processing. Be aware that for smaller raster maps, BZIP2 
compression ratio can be worse than other compression methods.</dd> 
<dt><strong>ZSTD</strong></dt>
<dd>ZSTD (Zstandard) provides compression ratios higher than ZLIB but 
lower than BZIP2 (for large data). ZSTD compresses up to 4x faster than 
ZLIB, and usually decompresses 6x faster than ZLIB. ZSTD is the 
default compression method if available.</dd> 
</dl>


<h2>NOTES</h2>

<h3>Compression method number scheme</h3>

The used compression method is encoded with numbers. In the internal
<tt>cellhd</tt> file, the value for "compressed" is 1 for RLE, 2
for ZLIB, 3 for LZ4, 4 for BZIP2, and 5 for ZSTD.
<p>
Obviously, decompression is controlled by the raster map's compression,
not by the environment variable.

<h3>Formats</h3>

Conceptually, a raster data file consists of rows of cells, with each 
row containing the same number of cells. A cell consists of one or more 
bytes. For CELL maps, the number of bytes per cell depends on the 
category values stored in the cell. Category values in the range 0-255 
require 1 byte per cell, while category values in the range 256-65535 
require 2 bytes, and category values in the range above 65535 require 3 
(or more) bytes per cell.
<p>
FCELL maps always have 4 bytes per cell and DCELL maps always have 8 
bytes per cell.

<p>
Since GRASS GIS 7.0.0, the default compression method for 
Integer (CELL) raster maps is ZLIB and no longer RLE.

<h3>ZLIB compression levels</h3>

If the environment variable <tt>GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL</tt> exists and
its value can be parsed as an integer, it determines the compression
level used when newly generated raster maps are compressed using ZLIB
compression. This applies to all raster map types (CELL, FCELL, DCELL).
<p>
<!-- TODO: check with implementation in lib/gis/gisinit.c line 128 -->
If the variable does not exist, or the value cannot be parsed as an
integer, ZLIB's compression level 1 will be used.
