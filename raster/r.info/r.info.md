## DESCRIPTION

*r.info* reports some basic information about a user-specified raster
map layer. This map layer must exist in the user's current mapset search
path. Information about the map's boundaries, resolution, projection,
data type, category number, project, mapset, project parent directory
(database directory), the timestamp and history are put into a table and
written to standard output. The types of information listed can also be
found in the *cats*, *cellhd*, and *hist* directories under the mapset
in which the named map is stored.

The user can save the tabular output to a file by using the UNIX
redirection mechanism (\>); for example, the user might save a report on
the *soils* map layer in a file called *soil.txt* by typing:

```sh
r.info map=soils > soil.txt
```

## NOTES

On large maps, the total number of cells in the map may not be displayed
with an accurate number. This is only cosmetic.

Some standards (ISO-C90) and compilers do not support the 'long long'
type as a 64-bit type. In the case that GRASS GIS was built with such a
compiler, an accuracy message may be displayed in the output of *r.info*
after Total Cells.

## EXAMPLES

Below is a full report produced by *r.info* for the raster map *slope*
in the North Carolina sample data base:

```sh

Alternatively, the output from *r.info* may be confined to a more terse
subset of the available information by passing various flags to the
module:

Output in shell script style, useful for eval
(`` eval `r.info -g slope` ``):

```sh
r.info -g slope
north=228500
south=215000
east=645000
west=630000
nsres=10
ewres=10
rows=1350
cols=1500
cells=2025000
datatype=FCELL
ncats=255
```

Output the map data range:

```sh
r.info -r slope
min=0
max=38.68939
```

Output the extended map data metadata in shell style:

```sh
r.info -e slope
map=slope
mapset=PERMANENT
project=nc_spm_08_grass7
database=/grassdata
date="Tue Nov  7 01:11:23 2006"
creator="helena"
title="South-West Wake county: slope in degrees (slope_ned10m)"
timestamp="none"
units="none"
vdatum="none"
semantic_label="none"
source1="raster elevation file elev_ned10m"
source2=""
description="generated by r.slope.aspect"
comments="slope map elev = elev_ned10mzfactor = 1.00 format = degreesmin_slp_allowed = 0.000000"
```

Finally, the output from *r.info* can be output in JSON by passing the
**format=json** option.

```sh
r.info slope format=json
```

```json
