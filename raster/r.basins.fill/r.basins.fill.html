<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.basins.fill</em>
generates a raster map layer depicting subbasins, based 
on input raster map layers for the coded stream network 
(where each channel segment has been "coded" with a unique category value) 
and for the ridges within a given watershed. 
The raster map layer depicting ridges should include 
the ridge which defines the perimeter of the watershed. 
The coded stream network can be generated 
as part of the 
<em><a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a></em> program, 
but the map layer of ridges will need to be created by hand
(for example, through digitizing done in <em><a href="wxGUI.Vector_Digitizer.html">wxGUI vector digitizer</a></em>).

<p>
The resulting output raster map layer will 
code the subbasins with category values matching 
those of the channel segments passing through them. 
A user-supplied number of passes through the data is 
made in an attempt to fill in these subbasins. 
If the resulting map layer from this program appears to 
have holes within a subbasin, the program should be 
rerun with a higher number of passes. 
<br><br>


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The current geographic region setting is ignored. 
Instead, the geographic region for the entire input stream's 
map layer is used.
