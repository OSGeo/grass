<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<i>r.sim.water</i> is a landscape scale simulation model 
of overland flow designed for spatially variable terrain, soil, cover 
and rainfall excess conditions. A 2D shallow water flow is described by 
the bivariate form of Saint Venant equations. The numerical solution is based
on the concept of duality between the field and particle representation of
the modeled quantity. Green's function Monte Carlo method, used to solve the equation,
provides robustness necessary for spatially variable conditions and high
resolutions (Mitas and Mitasova 1998). The key inputs of the model include
elevation (<i>elevin</i> raster map), flow gradient vector given by
first-order partial derivatives of elevation field (<i>dxin</i> and <i>dyin</i>
raster maps), rainfall excess rate (<i>rain</i> raster map or <i>rain_val</i> single
value) and a surface roughness coefficient given by Manning's n 
(<i>manin</i> raster map or <i>manin_val</i> single value). Partial
derivatives raster maps can be computed along with interpolation of a DEM using
the -d option in <a href="v.surf.rst.html">v.surf.rst</a> module. If elevation raster 
map is already provided, partial derivatives can be computed using
<a href="r.slope.aspect.html">r.slope.aspect</a> module. Partial derivatives are used
to determine the direction and magnitude of water flow velocity. To include a 
predefined direction of flow, map algebra can be used to replace terrain-derived
partial derivatives with pre-defined partial derivatives in selected grid cells such 
as man-made channels, ditches or culverts. Equations (2) and (3) from 
<a href="http://skagit.meas.ncsu.edu/~helena/gmslab/reports/cerl99/rep99.html">this report</a>
can be used to compute partial derivates of the predefined flow using its direction given
by aspect and slope.

<p>
The module automatically converts horizontal distances from feet to metric system using
database/projection information. Rainfall excess is defined as rainfall intensity
- infiltration rate and should be provided in [mm/hr].
<!-- and can be computed using several available infiltration
 models (e.g. Green-Ampt, Holtan, etc.). (<font color="#ff0000"> find
 infiltration module in GRASS - topmodel, casc2d</font> )
-->
Rainfall intensities are usually available from meteorological stations. 
Infiltration rate depends on soil properties and land cover. It varies in space and time.
For saturated soil and steady-state water flow it can be estimated using
saturated hydraulic conductivity rates based on field measurements or using
reference values which can be found in literature.
Optionally, user can provide an overland flow infiltration rate map 
<i>infil</i> or a single value <i>infil_val</i> in [mm/hr] that control the rate of
infiltration for the already flowing water, effectively reducing the flow depth and 
discharge.
Overland flow can be further controled by permeable check dams or similar type of structures,
the user can provide a map of these structures and their permeability ratio
in the map <i>traps</i> that defines the probability of particles to pass
through the structure (the values will be 0-1).

<p>
Output includes a water depth raster map <i>depth</i> in [m], and a water discharge 
raster map <i>disch</i> in [m3/s]. Error of the numerical solution can be analyzed using 
the <i>err</i> raster map (the resulting water depth is an average, and err is its RMSE).
The output vector points map <i>outwalk</i> can be used to analyze and visualize 
spatial distribution of walkers at different simulation times (note that 
the resulting water depth is based on the density of these walkers). 
<!--Number of the output walkers is controled by the <i>density</i> parameter, which controls
how many walkers used in simulation should be written into the output. -->
<!--(<font color="#ff0000"> toto treba upresnit/zmenit, lebo nwalk ide prec</font>). -->
Duration of simulation is controled by the <i>niter</i> parameter. The default value 
is 10 minutes, reaching the steady-state may require much longer time, 
depending on the time step, complexity of terrain, land cover and size of the area. 
Output walker, water depth and discharge maps can be saved during simulation using 
the time series flag <i>-t</i> and <i>outiter</i> parameter 
defining the time step in minutes for writing output files. 
Files are saved with a suffix representing time since the start of simulation in seconds 
(e.g. wdepth.500, wdepth.1000).
Monitoring of water depth at specific points is supported. A vector map with observation points and
a path to a logfile must be provided. For each point in the vector map which is located in
the computational region the water depth is logged each time step in the logfile. The logfile is
organized as a table. A single header identifies the category number of the logged vector points.
In case of invalid water depth data the value -1 is used.

<p>
Overland flow is routed based on partial derivatives of elevation
field or other landscape features influencing water flow. Simulation
equations include a diffusion term (<i>diffc</i> parameter) which enables 
water flow to overcome elevation depressions or obstacles when water depth exceeds 
a threshold water depth value (<i>hmax)</i>, given in [m]. When it is reached, 
diffusion term increases as given by <i>halpha</i> and advection term 
(direction of flow) is given as "prevailing" direction of flow computed
as average of flow directions from the previous <i>hbeta</i> number of grid cells.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

A 2D shallow water flow is described by the bivariate form of Saint
Venant equations (e.g., Julien et al., 1995). The continuity of water
flow relation is coupled with the momentum conservation equation and
for a shallow water overland flow, the hydraulic radius is approximated
by the normal flow depth. The system of equations is closed using the
Manning's relation. Model assumes that the flow is close to the kinematic
wave approximation, but we include a diffusion-like term to incorporate the
impact of diffusive wave effects. Such an incorporation of diffusion
in the water flow simulation is not new and a similar term has been obtained
in derivations of diffusion-advection equations for overland flow, e.g.,
by Lettenmeier and Wood, (1992). In our reformulation, we simplify the
diffusion coefficient to a constant and we use a modified diffusion term.
The diffusion constant which we have used is rather small (approximately
one order of magnitude smaller than the reciprocal Manning's coefficient)
and therefore the resulting flow is close to the kinematic regime. However,
the diffusion term improves the kinematic solution, by overcoming small
shallow pits common in digital elevation models (DEM) and by smoothing out
the flow over slope discontinuities or abrupt changes in Manning's coefficient
(e.g., due to a road, or other anthropogenic changes in elevations or cover).

<p>
<b>Green's function stochastic method of solution.</b><br>
The Saint Venant equations are solved by a stochastic method called Monte Carlo
(very similar to Monte Carlo methods in computational fluid dynamics or to
quantum Monte Carlo approaches for solving the Schrodinger equation (Schmidt
and Ceperley, 1992, Hammond et al., 1994; Mitas, 1996)). It is assumed
that these equations are a representation of stochastic processes with
diffusion and drift components (Fokker-Planck equations).

<p>
The Monte Carlo technique has several unique advantages which are
becoming even more important due to new developments in computer technology. 
Perhaps one of the most significant Monte Carlo properties is robustness 
which enables us to solve the equations for complex cases, such as discontinuities
in the coefficients of differential operators (in our case, abrupt slope
or cover changes, etc). Also, rough solutions can be estimated rather
quickly, which allows us to carry out preliminary quantitative studies
or to rapidly extract qualitative trends by parameter scans. In addition,
the stochastic methods are tailored to the new generation of computers
as they provide scalability from a single workstation to large parallel
machines due to the independence of sampling points. Therefore, the methods
are useful both for everyday exploratory work using a desktop computer and
for large, cutting-edge applications using high performance computing.
