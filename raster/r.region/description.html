<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r.region</em> program allows the user to manage the boundaries
of a raster map. These boundaries can be set by the user directly
and/or set from a region definition file (stored under the
<kbd>windows</kbd> directory in the user's current mapset), a raster
or vector map, or a 3dview file.
<p>

The <b>align</b> parameter allows to set the current resolution equal to
that of the named raster map, and align the boundaries to a row and column
edge in the named map.  Alignment only moves the existing boundaries outward
to the edges of the next nearest cell in the named raster map -- not to the
named map's edges.  To perform the latter function, use the
<b>raster=</b><em>name</em> option.

<h2>NOTE</h2>

After all updates have been applied, the raster map's resolution
settings are recomputed from the boundaries and the number of rows and
columns in the raster map.
