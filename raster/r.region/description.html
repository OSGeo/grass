<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <EM>r.region</EM> program allows the user to manage the boundaries
of a raster map. These boundaries can be set by the user directly
and/or set from a region definition file (stored under the
<KBD>windows</KBD> directory in the user's current mapset), a raster
or vector map, or a 3dview file.
<P>

The <B>align</B> parameter allows to set the current resolution equal to
that of the named raster map, and align the boundaries to a row and column
edge in the named map.  Alignment only moves the existing boundaries outward
to the edges of the next nearest cell in the named raster map -- not to the
named map's edges.  To perform the latter function, use the
<B>raster=</B><EM>name</EM> option.

<H2>NOTE</H2>

After all updates have been applied, the raster map's resolution
settings are recomputed from the boundaries and the number of rows and
columns in the raster map.
