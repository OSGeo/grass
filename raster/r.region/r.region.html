<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r.region</em> program allows the user to manage the boundaries
of a raster map. These boundaries can be set by the user directly
and/or set from a region definition file (stored under the
<kbd>windows</kbd> directory in the user's current mapset), a raster
or vector map, or a 3dview file.
<p>
The <b>align</b> parameter sets the current resolution equal to
that of the named raster map, and align the boundaries to a row and column
edge in the named map.  Alignment only moves the existing boundaries outward
to the edges of the next nearest cell in the named raster map -- not to the
named map's edges.  To perform the latter function, use the
<b>raster=</b><em>name</em> option.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

After all updates have been applied, the raster map's resolution
settings are recomputed from the boundaries and the number of rows and
columns in the raster map.

<p>The n=<em>value</em> may also be specified as a
function of its current value:  n=n+<em>value</em>
increases the current northing, while n=n-<em>value</em>
decreases it.  This is also true for s=<em>value</em>,
e=<em>value</em>, and w=<em>value</em>.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Assign absolute coordinates to map:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.region map=mymap n=220750 s=220000 w=638300 e=639000
</pre></div>

Shift map (using offset, here by 100 map units in two directions):
<div class="code"><pre>
r.region map=mymap n=n+100 e=e+100 w=w+100 s=s+100
</pre></div>
