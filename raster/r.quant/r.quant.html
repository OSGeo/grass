<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.quant</em> produces the quantization file for a floating-point map.
<p>
The <em>map</em> parameter defines the map for which the rules are to be
created. If more than one map is specified, then this implies that the
floating-point range is the minimum and maximum of all the maps together,
unless either <em>basemap=map</em> or <em>fprange=min,max</em> is specified.

<h3>Quant rules</h3>

The quant rules have to be entered interactively.
<p>
If rules is specified, the input has the form:
<p>

<div class="code"><pre>
value1:value2:cat1:[cat2]
</pre></div>

<p>
where <em>value1</em> and <em>value2</em> are floating point values and
<em>cat1</em> and <em>cat2</em> are integers. If <em>cat2</em> is missing,
it is taken to be equal to <em>cat1</em>. All values
can be <em>"*"</em> which means infinity.

<h2>NOTE</h2>

It is an error to specify both <em>basemap</em> and <em>fprange</em>.
