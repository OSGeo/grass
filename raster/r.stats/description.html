<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r.stats</EM> calculates the area present in each of the categories of
user-selected raster map layer(s). Area statistics are given in units of
square meters and/or cell counts. This analysis uses the current geographic
region and mask settings. Output can be sent to a file in the user's current
working directory.

If a single map layer is specified on the command line, a list of areas in
square meters (assuming the map's coordinate system is in meters) for each
category in the raster map layer will be printed. (If the <EM>-c</EM> option
is chosen, areas will be stated in number of cells.) If multiple raster map
layers are specified on the command line, a cross-tabulation table of areas
for each combination of categories in the map layers will be printed.

<P>
For example, if one raster map layer were specified, the output would look like:
<PRE>
          1:1350000.00
          2:4940000.00
          3:8870000.00
</PRE>
If three raster map layers <EM>a, b</EM>, and <EM>c</EM>, were specified,
the output would look like:
<PRE>
          0:0:0:8027500.00
          0:1:0:1152500.00
          1:0:0:164227500.00
          1:0:1:2177500.00
          1:1:0:140092500.00
          1:1:1:3355000.00
          2:0:0:31277500.00
          2:0:1:2490000.00
          2:1:0:24207500.00
          2:1:1:1752500.00
          3:0:0:17140000.00
          3:1:0:11270000.00
          3:1:1:2500.00
</PRE>
Within each grouping, the first field represents the category  value of map
layer <EM>a</EM>, the second represents the category values associated with
map layer <EM>b</EM>, the third represents category values for map layer
<EM>c</EM>, and the last field gives the area in square meters for the
particular combination of these three map layers' categories. For example,
above, combination 3,1,1 covered 2500 square meters. Fields are separated by
colons.

<H2>NOTES</H2>
<EM>r.stats</EM> works in the current geographic region with the current mask.

<P>
If a nicely formatted output is desired, pipe the output into a command
which can create columnar output.  For example, the command:

<P>
    <B>r.stats input=</B>a,b,c | pr -3 | cat -s

<P>
will create a three-column output 
<PRE>
1:4:4:10000.00       2:1:5:290000.00      2:4:5:2090000.00
1:4:5:1340000.00     2:2:5:350000.00      3:1:2:450000.00
2:1:1:1090000.00     2:4:1:700000.00      3:1:3:5280000.00
2:1:3:410000.00      2:4:3:10000.00       3:1:5:3140000.00
</PRE>

The output from <EM>r.stats</EM> on more than one map layer is sorted.

<P>
Note that the user has only the option of printing out cell statistics in
terms of cell counts and/or area totals. Users wishing to use different
units than are available here should use the GRASS program
