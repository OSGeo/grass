<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b>r.sun</b> computes beam (direct), diffuse and ground reflected solar
irradiation raster maps for given day, latitude, surface and atmospheric
conditions. Solar parameters (e.g. time of sunrise and sunset, declination,
extraterrestrial irradiance, daylight length) are stored in the resultant maps'
history files. Alternatively, the local time can be specified to compute solar
incidence angle and/or irradiance raster maps. The shadowing effect of the
topography is optionally incorporated, a correction factor for shadowing to account
for the earth curvature is internally calucated.<br>
The units of the parameters are specified in brackets, a hyphen in the brackets
explains that the parameter has no units.
<p>
For latitude-longitude coordinates it requires that the elevation map is in meters.
The rules are:
<ul>
<li> lat/lon coordinates: elevation in meters;
<li> Other coordinates: elevation in the same unit as the easting-northing coordinates.
</ul>

<p>
The solar geometry of the model is based on the works of Krcho (1990), later
improved by Jenco (1992). The equations describing Sun -- Earth position as
well as an interaction of the solar radiation with atmosphere were originally 
based on the formulas suggested by Kitler and Mikler (1986). This component 
was considerably updated by the results and suggestions of the working group
co-ordinated by Scharmer and Greif (2000) (this algorithm might be replaced
by SOLPOS algorithm-library included in GRASS within <a href="r.sunmask.html">
r.sunmask</a>
 command). The model computes all three components of global radiation (beam, 
diffuse and reflected) for the clear sky conditions, i.e. not taking into 
consideration the spatial and temporal variation of clouds. The extent and
spatial resolution of the modelled area, as well as integration over time,
are limited only by the memory and data storage resources. The model is built
to fulfil user needs in various fields of science (hydrology, climatology,
ecology and environmental sciences, photovoltaics, engineering, etc.) for
continental, regional up to the landscape scales. 
<p>As an option the model considers a shadowing effect of the local topography. 
The r.sun program works in two modes. In the first mode it calculates for the set 
local time a solar incidence angle [degrees] and solar irradiance values [W.m-2].
In the second mode daily sums of solar radiation [Wh.m-2.day-1] are computed
within a set day. By a scripting the two modes can be used separately or
in a combination to provide estimates for any desired time interval. The
model accounts for sky obstruction by local relief features. Several solar
parameters are saved in the resultant maps' history files, which may be viewed
with the <a href="r.info.html">r.info</a> command.
</p>
<p>The solar incidence angle raster map <i>incidout</i> is computed specifying 
elevation raster map <i>elevin</i>, aspect raster map <i>aspin</i>, slope 
steepness raster map <i>slopin,</i> given the day <i>day</i> and local time
<i>time</i>. There is no need to define latitude for locations with known
and defined projection/coordinate system (check it with the <a href="g.proj.html">
g.proj</a>
 command). If you have undefined projection, (x,y) system, etc. then the latitude
can be defined explicitely for large areas by input raster map <i>latin</i>
 with interpolated latitude values or, for smaller areas, a single region 
latitude value <i>lat</i> can be used instead. All input raster maps must
be floating point (FCELL) raster maps. Null data in maps are excluded from
the computation (and also speeding-up the computation), so each output raster
map will contain null data in cells according to all input raster maps. The
user can use <a href="r.null.html">r.null</a>
 command to create/reset null file for your input raster maps. <br>
The specified day <i>day</i> is the number of the day of the general year
where January 1 is day no.1 and December 31 is 365. Time <i>time</i> must
be a local (solar) time (i.e. NOT a zone time, e.g. GMT, CET) in decimal system,
e.g. 7.5 (= 7h 30m A.M.), 16.1 = 4h 6m P.M.. </p>
<p>Setting the solar declination <i>declin</i> by user is an option to override
the value computed by the internal routine for the day of the year. The value
of geographical latitude can be set as a constant for the whole computed
region or, as an option, a grid representing spatially distributed values
over a large region. The geographical latitude must be also in decimal system
with positive values for northern hemisphere and negative for southern one.
In similar principle the Linke turbidity factor (<i>linkein</i>, <i>lin</i>
) and ground albedo (<i>albedo</i>, <i>alb</i>) can be set. </p>
<p>Besides clear-sky radiations, user can compute a real-sky radiation (beam,
diffuse) using <i>coefbh</i> and <i>coefdh </i>input raster maps defining
the fraction of the respective clear-sky radiations reduced by atmospheric
factors (e.g. cloudiness). The value is between 0-1. Usually these
coefficients can be obtained from a long-terms meteorological measurements.</p>
<p>The solar irradiation or irradiance raster maps <i>beam_rad</i>, <i>diff_rad</i>
, <i>refl_rad</i> are computed for a given day <i>day,</i> latitude <i>lat
(latin), </i>elevation <i>elevin</i>, slope <i>slopein</i> and aspect <i>
aspin</i> raster maps. The program uses the Linke atmosphere turbidity factor
and ground albedo coefficient. A default, single value of Linke factor is
<i>lin</i>=3.0 and is near the annual average for rural-city areas. The Linke
factor for an absolutely clear atmosphere is <i>lin</i>=1.0. See notes below
to learn more about this factor. The incidence solar angle is the angle between
horizon and solar beam vector. The solar radiation maps for given day are
computed integrating the relevant irradiance between sunrise and sunset times
for given day. The user can set finer or coarser time step <i>step</i> used 
for all-day radiation calculations. A default value of <i>step</i> is 0.5 
hour. Larger steps (e.g. 1.0-2.0) can speed-up calculations but produce less
reliable results. The output units are in Wh per squared meter per given
day [Wh/(m*m)/day]. The incidence angle and irradiance/irradiation maps can
be computed without shadowing influence of relief by default or they can
be computed with this influence using the flag <i>-s</i>. In mountainous areas
this can lead to very different results! The user should be aware that taken
into account the shadowing effect of relief can slow
down the speed of computing especially when the sun altitude is low.
 When considering shadowing effect (flag <i>-s</i>) speed and precision computing
can be controlled by a parameter <i>dist</i> which defines the sampling density
at which the visibility of a grid cell is computed in the direction of a
path of the solar flow. It also defines the method by which the obstacle's
altitude is computed. When choosing <i>dist</i> less than 1.0 (i.e. sampling
points will be computed at <i>dist</i> * cellsize distance), r.sun takes
altitude from the nearest grid point. Values above 1.0 will use the maximum
altitude value found in the nearest 4 surrounding grid points. The default
value <i>dist</i>=1.0 should give reasonable results for most cases (e.g.
on DEM). <i>Dist</i> value defines a multiplying coefficient for sampling
distance. This basic sampling distance equals to the arithmetic average of
both cell sizes. The reasonable values are in the range 0.5-1.5.  The values
below 0.5 will decrease and values above 1.0 will increase the computing
speed. Values greater than 2.0 may produce estimates with lower accuracy
in highly dissected relief. The fully shadowed areas are written to the ouput
maps as zero values. Areas with NULL data are considered as no barrier with
shadowing effect .</p>
<p>The maps' history files are generated containing the following listed 
parameters used in the computation: <br>
- Solar constant 1367 W.m-2 <br>
- Extraterrestrial irradiance on a plane perpendicular to the solar beam
[W.m-2] <br>
- Day of the year <br>
- Declination [radians] <br>
- Decimal hour (Alternative 1 only) <br>
- Sunrise and sunset (min-max) over a horizontal plane <br>
- Daylight lengths <br>
- Geographical latitude (min-max) <br>
- Linke turbidity factor (min-max) <br>
- Ground albedo (min-max) </p>
<p>The user can use a nice shellcript with variable
day to compute radiation for some time interval within the year (e.g. vegetation
or winter period). Elevation, aspect and slope input values should not be
reclassified into coarser categories. This could lead to incorrect results. 
</p>

<h2> OPTIONS</h2>
<p>Currently, there are two modes of r.sun.
In the first mode it calculates solar incidence angle and solar irradiance
raster maps using the set local time. In the second mode daily sums of solar
irradiation [Wh.m-2.day-1] are computed for a specified day.</p>

<h2>
NOTES</h2>

Solar energy is an important input parameter in different models concerning 
energy industry, landscape, vegetation, evapotranspiration, snowmelt or remote
sensing. Solar rays incidence angle maps can be effectively used in radiometric
and topographic corrections in mountainous and hilly terrain where very accurate
investigations should be performed. 
<p>
The clear-sky solar radiation model applied in the r.sun is based on the
work undertaken for development of European Solar Radiation Atlas (Scharmer 
and Greif 2000, Page et al. 2001, Rigollier 2001). The clear sky model estimates
the global radiation from the sum of its beam, diffuse and reflected components.
The main difference between solar radiation models for inclined surfaces
in Europe is the treatment of the diffuse component. In the European climate
this component is often the largest source of estimation error. Taking into
consideration the existing models and their limitation the European Solar
Radiation Atlas team selected the Muneer (1990) model as it has a sound theoretical
basis and thus more potential for later improvement. </p>

<p>
Planned improvements include the use of the SOLPOS algorithm for solar 
geometry calculations and internal computation of aspect and slope.

<h3>Shadow maps</h3>
A map of shadows can be extracted from the solar incidence angle map
(incidout). Areas with zero values are shadowed. The <em>-s</em> flag
has to be used.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Nice looking maps can be created with the model's output as follows:
