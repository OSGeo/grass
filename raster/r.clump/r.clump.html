<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.clump</em> finds all areas of contiguous cell category values in
the input raster map. NULL values in the input are ignored. It assigns 
a unique category value to each such area (&quot;clump&quot;) in the 
resulting output raster map.

<p>
Category distinctions in the input raster map are preserved.  This
means that if distinct category values are adjacent, they will NOT be
clumped together. The user can
run <em><a href="r.reclass.html">r.reclass</a></em> prior
to <em>r.clump</em> to recategorize cells and reassign cell category
values.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

By default, the resulting clumps are connected only by their four 
direct neighbors (left, right, top, bottom). The <em>-d</em> flag 
activates also diagonal clump tracing.

<p>
<em>r.clump</em> works properly with raster map that contains only
&quot;fat&quot; areas (more than a single cell in width). Linear
elements (lines that are a single cell wide) may or may not be clumped
together depending on the direction of the line - horizontal and
vertical lines of cells are considered to be contiguous, but diagonal
lines of cells are not considered to be contiguous and are broken up
into separate clumps unless the <em>-d</em> flag is used.

<p>
A random color table and other support files are generated for the
output raster map.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Perform clumping on "lakes" map (North Carolina sample dataset) and
report area sizes for each lake individually rather by waterbody type:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=lakes -p

# report sizes by waterbody type
r.report lakes units=h

# clump per raster polygon
r.clump lakes out=lakes_individual

# report sizes by individual waterbody
r.report lakes_individual units=a
</pre></div>
