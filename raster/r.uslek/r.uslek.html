<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.uslek</em> calculates the USLE K factor, that is the Soil Erodibility
Factor. It takes input of soil texture classes (sand, clay, silt) and
organic matter, all in range of [0.0-1.0]. The FAO World Soil CD
documentation was used to produce the conversion system between soil
textures and soil classes. The soil classes are in number of 12 and
apparently come from a USDA publication of 1951 (p.209). Once the soil
classes have been identified (by vector cross-products tests), a general
conversion table was applied for transforming soil classes into K factor.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<em>r.watershed</em> provides for USLE L, S, LS factors.
