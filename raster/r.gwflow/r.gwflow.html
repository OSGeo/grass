<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
This numerical program calculates implicit transient, confined and
unconfined groundwater flow in two dimensions based on  
raster maps and the current region settings.
All initial and boundary conditions must be provided as 
raster maps. The unit in the location must be meters.
<p>This module is sensitive to mask settings. All cells which are outside the mask
are ignored and handled as no flow boundaries.

<p>
<em>r.gwflow</em> calculates the piezometric head and optionally 
the water budget and the filter velocity field,
based on the hydraulic conductivity and the piezometric head. 
The vector components can be visualized with paraview if they are exported
with <em>r.out.vtk</em>.
<br>
<br>
The groundwater flow will always be calculated transient. 
For stady state computation set the timestep
to a large number (billions of seconds) or set the 
storativity/ effective porosity raster map to zero.
<br>
<br>
The water budget is calculated for each non inactive cell. The
sum of the budget for each non inactive cell must be near zero.
This is an indicator of the quality of the numerical result.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The groundwater flow calculation is based on Darcy's law and a numerical implicit
finite volume discretization. The discretization results in a symmetric and positive definite
linear equation system in form of <i>Ax = b</i>, which must be solved. The groundwater flow partial
differential equation is of the following form:

<p>(dh/dt)*S = div (K grad h) + q
<p>In detail for 2 dimensions:
<p>(dh/dt)*S = Kxx * (d^2h/dx^2) + Kyy * (d^2h/dy^2) + q

<ul>
<li>h -- the piezometric head im [m]</li>
<li>dt -- the time step for transient calculation in [s]</li>
<li>S -- the specific storage [1/m]</li>
<li>Kxx -- the hydraulic conductivity tensor part in x direction in [m/s]</li>
<li>Kyy -- the hydraulic conductivity tensor part in y direction in [m/s]</li>
<li>q - inner source/sink in meter per second [1/s]</li>
</ul>

<p>Confined and unconfined groundwater flow is supported. Be aware that the storativity input parameter
is handled differently in case of unconfined flow. Instead of the storativity, the effective porosity is expected.
<p>To compute unconfined groundwater flow, a simple Picard based linearization scheme is used to
solve the resulting non-linear equation system.
<p>Two different boundary conditions are implemented, 
the Dirichlet and Neumann conditions. By default the calculation area is surrounded by homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.
The calculation and boundary status of single cells must be set with a status map, 
the following states are supportet:

<ul>
<li>0 == inactive - the cell with status 0 will not be calculated, active cells will have a no flow boundary to this cell</li>
<li>1 == active - this cell is used for groundwater floaw calculation, inner sources and recharge can be defined for those cells</li>
<li>2 == Dirichlet - cells of this type will have a fixed piezometric head value which do not change over the time </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Note that all required raster maps are read into main memory. Additionally the
linear equation system will be allocated, so the memory consumption of this
module rapidely grow with the size of the input maps.
<br>
<br>
The resulting linear equation system <i>Ax = b</i> can be solved with several solvers.
An iterative solvers with sparse and quadratic matrices support is implemented.
The conjugate gradients method with (pcg) and without (cg) precondition.
Additionally a direct Cholesky solver is available. This direct solver
only work with normal quadratic matrices, so be careful using them with large maps 
(maps of size 10.000 cells will need more than one gigabyte of RAM).
Always prefer a sparse matrix solver.

Use this small script to create a working
groundwater flow area and data. Make sure you are not in a lat/lon projection.
It includes drainage and river input as well.
