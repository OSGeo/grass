######### PREREQUISITE

In order to use this program, you need to have the program "mpeg_encode",
available from Berkeley:
    http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/frame/research/mpeg/mpeg_encode.html
or "ppmtompeg" from the netpbm package:
    http://netpbm.sourceforge.net

Both source code and binaries for several platforms are available.

## old:
After successful compilation, put the executable named "mpeg_encode" in
a bin/ directory that any users of GRASS have in their path
(I put it in /usr/local/bin or you could put it in $(GISBASE)/bin)
If you intend to use ppmtompeg, make sure you make a soft link to it:
    ln -s /usr/bin/ppmtompeg /usr/local/bin/mpeg_encode
## /old

## new:
Make sure the "mpeg_encode" or "ppmtompeg" binary executable is somewhere
in the PATH.
## /new


I have mpeg_encode version 1.3 and found one bug that you may need to fix (it's been
reported, but probably not fixed in the current release yet):

mpeg_encode version 1.3, file param.c, around line 770:

	} else {
	    strcpy(inputFileEntries[numInputFileEntries]->left, input);
	    inputFileEntries[numInputFileEntries]->glob = FALSE;
	    inputFileEntries[numInputFileEntries]->numFiles = 1;

	    /********* I added this line to FIX bug: ************/
	    inputFileEntries[numInputFileEntries]->numPadding = 0;
	}

######### MPEG Players

There are a couple of versions for X that I know of:

The standard player -
  ftp://mm-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/multimedia/mpeg/play/

Debian package (+source code):
  http://packages.debian.org/ucbmpeg-play

An enhanced version of above with Motif playback controls:
 (ftp site no longer functional??)
ftp ftp.geom.umn.edu
/priv/daeron/bin/mpeg_play-arch.tar.Z (where arch = your machine architecture)


There are also Public Domain or shareware players available
for Windows and MacIntosh at various sites on the internet.

######### THIS VERSION:

Added the -c option for "on the fly" conversion (using prerequisite
r.out.ppm with stdout option, available on moon.cecer.army.mil).  This
saves disk space, but can only be used when there is a single viewframe.
Use of this option will also override any size specification, producing
an MPEG with the dimensions of the CURRENTLY DEFINED GRASS REGION.  So
set your region carefully before using this option.
