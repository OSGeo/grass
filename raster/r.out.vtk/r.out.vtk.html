<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Outputs <i>raster</i> maps in <i>VTK-ASCII</i> format. <i>Map's</i> are
valid raster map's in the current mapset.  <i>output</i> is the name of
an VTK-ASCII file which will be written in the current working directory.
If <i>output</i> is not specified then <b>stdout</b> is used.  
The module is sensitive to region settings (set with g.region).
<p>

Elevation, scaling, point/celldata, vector and RGB Data are supported.
If the map is in LL projection, the elevation values will automatically scaled to 
degrees. It is supposed that the elevation values are provided in meters. 
If the elevation values are in a different unit than meters, use 
the scale parameter to convert the units. 
<p>

If no elevation map is given, the user can set the hight of the map by one value. 
Point or cell data are available. Also scaling is supported for this elevation value. 
The elevation value must be provided in meters.
<p>

The RGB input requires three raster maps: red, green, blue  - in this order. 
The maps must have values between 0 and 255, otherwise you will get lots of warnings
and the values are set to 0.
More than one RGB dataset (3 maps) is not supported. 
<p>

The vector input requires three raster maps: x, y, z -- defining the vector coordinates  - in this order. 
More than one vector dataset (3 maps) is not supported. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>
This filter generates: 
<ul>
<li><i>structured points</i> with <i>celldata</i> or <i>pointdata</i> if no elevationfile is given</li>

<li><i>structured grid</i> (not recommendet) with <i>pointdata</i> if an elevationfile is given</li>
<li><i>polydataset</i> with <i>pointdata</i> if an elevationfile is given (default)</li> 
</ul>
and puts this in a simple VTK-ASCII file. Nor XML or 
binary output are supported. It is possible to choose more then one raster map
to be written to the VTK-ASCII file. Each cell-/pointdata is named like the raster map it represents.
You can visualize this file with the 
<em><a href="http://www.vtk.org">VTK Toolkit</a></em>, 
<em><a href="http://www.paraview.org">Paraview</a></em> and 
<em><a href="http://mayavi.sourceforge.net">MayaVi</a></em> which are based on VTK.
If you have a raster map with partly no data, use the threshold filter in paraview to 
visualize the valid data. Just filter all data which is greater/lesser than the 
chosen null value in the VTK-ASCII file.
<br>
If elevation map is chosen, a polygonal grid is created with <i>quads</i>, 
but the user can choose also <i>triangle strips</i> or <i>vertices</i>. 
These dataformats a documented at <em><a href="http://www.vtk.org">VTK Toolkit</a></em>.
<p>

If the "-c" flag is used and the data should be visualised together with other data exported via *.out.vtk
modules, be sure the "-c" flag was also set in these modules.
But this will only work with data from the SAME location 
(The reference point for the coordinates transformation is based on the center point of the default region).

<h3>Difference between point- and celldata</h3>

r.out.vtk can export raster cells with different representations.
<ul>
   <li>
      <i>pointdata</i> -- the cells/values are represented by the center of the cell. 
      Instead of cells, points are created. Each point can hold different values, 
      but the user can only visualize one value at a time. These points can 
      be connected in different ways.
   </li>
   <li>
       <i>celldata</i> -- is only provided if no elevation map is given. 
       The cells are created with the same hight and width as in GRASS. Each cell 
       can hold different values, but the user can only visualize one value at a time. 
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<h3>Simple Spearfish example</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
# set region
g.region n=4926970 s=4914857 w=591583 e=607793 res=50 -p

# export the data
r.out.vtk input=elevation.10m,slope,aspect elevation=elevation.10m output=/tmp/out.vtk

# visualize in Paraview or other VTK viewer:
paraview --data=/tmp/out.vtk
</pre></div>

<h3>Spearfish example with RGB data</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
#set the region
g.region n=4926990 s=4914840 w=591570 e=607800 res=30 -p

# using r.in.wms to create RGB data to get a satellite coverage
r.in.wms layers=global_mosaic mapserver=http://wms.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi \
         output=wms_global_mosaic

# export the data to VTK
r.out.vtk rgbmaps=wms_global_mosaic.red,wms_global_mosaic.green,wms_global_mosaic.blue \
          elevation=elevation.10m output=/tmp/out.vtk

# visualize in Paraview or other VTK viewer:
paraview --data=/tmp/out.vtk
</pre></div>

<b>Paraview RGB visualization notes</b><br>
To achieve proper RGB overlay:
<ul>
<li> In Paraview, click "Apply"
<li> Select the "Display" tab and choose "Color by" to switch from input scalars to rgb scalars
<li> Disable the "Map Scalars" check button in the display tab to avoid the use of a lookup table 
</ul>
