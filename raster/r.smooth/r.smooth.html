<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The module performs an adaptive (edge pereserving) raster smoothing.
The module implements three diffusivity (conductance) functions:
exponential and quadratic (as sugessted by Perona & Malik 1990) and
Tukey's biweight (as suggested by Black et al. 1998).</p>
<p>Implementation of the Tukey's biweight diffusivity function is quite
agressive and tends to produce continuous smoothed areas. Its output is
well suited for raster segmentation. The <em>-p</em> flag allows to switch
into a more gentle variation of the function that better preserves minor
details and thus is better suited e.g. for visualization.</p>
<p>The <em>threshold</em> parameter is in map units (DN, meters, etc.)
and serves an indicator on how small difference should be considered as
just noise. It will be different for each map.</p>
<p>The <em>lambda</em> parameter impacts smoothing speed. For exponential
and quadratic diffusivity functions the value is authomatically bound
to range of 0 to 0.25. For the Tukey diffusivity function full range is
available.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>Internally calculations are performed in double precision and only at the end
converted to the same type as the input map.</p>

<h2>PERFORMANCE</h2>

<p>The module will try to keep all temporary data in RAM. Thus it is important
to set the <em>memory</em> parameter as high as possible.</p>
