<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The module performs an adaptive (edge pereserving) raster smoothing
with anisotropic diffusion.
The module implements three diffusivity (conductance) functions:
exponential and quadratic (as sugessted by Perona & Malik 1990) and
Tukey's biweight (as suggested by Black et al. 1998).</p>
<p>Implementation of the Tukey's biweight diffusivity function is quite
agressive and tends to produce continuous smoothed areas. Its output is
well suited for raster segmentation. The <em>-p</em> flag allows to switch
into a more gentle variation of the function that better preserves minor
details and thus is better suited e.g. for visualization.</p>
<p>The <em>threshold</em> parameter is in map units (DN, meters, etc.)
and serves an indicator on how small difference should be considered as
noise. It will be different for each map.</p>
<p>The <em>lambda</em> parameter impacts smoothing speed. For exponential
and quadratic diffusivity functions the value is authomatically bound
to range of 0 to 0.25. For the Tukey diffusivity function full range is
available.</p>
<p>The <em>steps</em> parameter sets number of iterations for smoothing.
Depending on selected diffusivity function, large number of iterations
can result in a loss of fine details. In terms of detail preservation
functions can be ordered with increasing preservation as <em>quadratic,
exponental, Tukey, Tukey with the -p flag</em>.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>Internally calculations are performed in double precision and only at the end
converted to the same type as the input map.</p>

<p>The module will try to keep all temporary data in RAM. Thus it is important
to set the <em>memory</em> parameter as high as possible.</p>

<p>The original Perona & Malik paper uses von Neumann (4-connected) neibourhood for
value calculation, but this module uses Moore (8-connected) neibourhood.
Computed gradients of neigbouring cells are adjusted to equalize distances for
diagonals and non-square cells.</p>

<div><pre class="code">
# Set computational region to orthophoto map
g.region raster=ortho_2001_t792_1m -p

# Smooth with average in a 3x3 window. Note how all edges have became blury
# but at the same time streets and roofs are still noisy
r.neighbors input=ortho_2001_t792_1m output=ortho_smoothed_avg\
 size=3 method=average

# Smooth with median in a 3x3 window. Although better than average smoothing,
# thin lines still are lost and noise on streets and roofs is still present.
r.neighbors input=ortho_2001_t792_1m output=ortho_smoothed_med\
 size=3 method=median

# Smooth with quadratic diffusivity function. Note better preservation of
# small details and reduction of noise on streets and roofs.
r.smooth function=quadratic input=ortho_2001_t792_1m output=ortho_smoothed_qa\
 threshold=15 lambda=0.4 steps=20

# Smooth with exponental diffusivity function. Even better edge delineation
# but at the same time increase of noise in really noisy areas.
r.smooth function=exponental input=ortho_2001_t792_1m output=ortho_smoothed_ex\
 threshold=15 lambda=0.4 steps=20

# Smooth with agressive Tukey's diffusivity function. Better preservation of
# minor details e.g. as road markings but little smoothing in areas with
# fine, well expressed texture.
r.smooth function=tukey input=ortho_2001_t792_1m output=ortho_smoothed_ta\
 threshold=15 lambda=0.4 steps=20

# Smooth with preserving Tukey's diffusivity function. Only low noise areas
# have been smoothed.
