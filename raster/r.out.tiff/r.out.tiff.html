<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This program converts a GRASS raster map to a TIFF raster map. Output may
be 8 or 24 bit (TrueColor).  Optionally, a TIFF World file compatible with
ESRI's and other's products may be output.

<p>
The program prompts the user for the name of a GRASS raster map, an output
TIFF file, whether an 8 or 24 bit format is desired, and whether or not to
create a TIFF world file.  Currently only uncompressed, packpit, or deflate
TIFF files are written.  These output formats are known to be compatible
with r.in.tiff.

<p>
The output filename will always have the suffix <code>.tif</code>, and the Tiff World
file (if requested) <code>.tfw</code>. Any <code>.tif</code> or
<code>.tiff</code> suffix (case insensitive) specified in the output filename 
will be discarded.

<p>
When writing with "-l" option, tiles are written at 128x128 pixels.  For
programs that can utilize tiles, it can help speed up some drawing
operations.

<p>
The user may adjust region and resolution before export using
<a href="g.region.html">g.region</a>.

<p>
A better choice to export GRASS raster data might be
<a href="r.out.gdal.html">r.out.gdal</a>.
