<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.texture</em> creates raster maps with textural features from a
user-specified raster map layer. The module calculates textural features
based on spatial dependence matrices at 0, 45, 90, and 135
degrees.

<p>
In order to take into account the scale of the texture to be measured,
<em>r.texture</em> allows the user to define the <em>size</em> of the moving
window and the <em>distance</em> at which to compare pixel grey values.  By
default the module averages the results over the 4 orientations, but the user
can also request output of the texture variables in 4 different orientations
(flag <em>-s</em>). Please note that angles are defined in degrees of east and
they increase counterclockwise, so 0 is East - West, 45 is North-East -
South-West, 90 is North - South, 135 is North-West - South-East.

<p>
The user can either chose one or several texture measures (see below for their
description) using the <em>method</em> parameter, or can request the creating
of maps for all available methods with the <em>-a</em>.

<p>
<em>r.texture</em> assumes grey levels ranging from 0 to 255 as input.  The
input is automatically rescaled to 0 to 255 if the input map range is outside of
this range.  In order to reduce noise in the input data (thus generally
reinforcing the textural features), and to speed up processing, it is
recommended that the user recode the data using equal-probability quantization.
Quantization rules for <em>r.recode</em> can be generated with <em>r.quantile
-r</em> using e.g 16 or 32 quantiles (see example below).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
Texture is a feature of specific land cover classes in satellite imagery.
It is particularly useful in situations where spectral differences between
classes are small, but classes are distinguishable by their organisation on the
ground, often opposing natural to human-made spaces: cultivated fields vs meadows
or golf courses, palm tree plantations vs natural rain forest, but texture can
also be a natural phenomen: dune fields, different canopies due to different
tree species. The usefulness and use of texture is highly dependent on the
resolution of satellite imagery and on the scale of the human intervention or
the phenomenon that created the texture (also see the discussion of scale
dependency below). The user should observe the phenomenon visually in order to
determine an adequate setting of the <em>size</em> parameter.

<p>
The output of <em>r.texture</em> can constitute very useful additional variables
as input for image classification or image segmentation (object recognition).
It can be used in supervised classification algorithms such as
<a href="i.maxlik.html">i.maxlik</a> or <a href="i.smap.html">i.smap</a>,
or for the identification of objects in <a href="i.segment.html">i.segment</a>,
and/or for the characterization of these objects and thus, for example, as one
of the raster inputs of the
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/addons/i.segment.stats.html">i.segment.stats</a>
addon.

<p>
In general, several variables constitute texture: differences in grey level values,
coarseness as scale of grey level differences, presence or lack of directionality
and regular patterns. A texture can be characterized by tone (grey level intensity
properties) and structure (spatial relationships). Since textures are highly scale
dependent, hierarchical textures may occur.

<p>
<em>r.texture</em> uses the common texture model based on the so-called grey
level co-occurrence matrix as described by Haralick et al (1973). This matrix
is a two-dimensional histogram of grey levels for a pair of pixels which are
separated by a fixed spatial relationship. The matrix approximates the joint
probability distribution of a pair of pixels. Several texture measures are
directly computed from the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM).

The provided measures can be categorized under first-order and
second-order statistics, with each playing a unique role in texture
analysis. First-order statistics consider the distribution of
individual pixel values without regard to spatial relationships, while
second-order statistics, particularly those derived from the Grey Level
Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), consider the spatial relationship of
pixels.

<p>
The following part offers brief explanations of the Haralick et al texture
measures (after Jensen 1996).

<h3>First-order statistics in the spatial domain</h3>
<ul>
<li> Sum Average (SA):
 Sum Average measures the average gray level intensity of the sum of
 pixel pairs within the moving window. It reflects the average intensity
 of pixel pairs at specific distances and orientations, highlighting the
 overall brightness level within the area.</li>

<li> Entropy (ENT):
 This measure analyses the randomness. It is high when the values of the
 moving window have similar values. It is low when the values are close
 to either 0 or 1 (i.e. when the pixels in the local window are
 uniform).</li>

<li> Difference Entropy (DE):
 This metric quantifies the randomness or unpredictability in the
 distribution of differences between the grey levels of pixel pairs. It
 is a measure of the entropy of the pixel-pair difference histogram,
 capturing texture granularity.</li>

<li> Sum Entropy (SE): Similar to Difference Entropy, Sum Entropy measures
 the randomness or unpredictability, but in the context of the sum of the
 grey levels of pixel pairs. It evaluates the entropy of the pixel-pair
 sum distribution, providing insight into the complexity of texture in
 terms of intensity variation.</li>

<li> Variance (VAR):
 A measure of gray tone variance within the moving window (second-order
 moment about the mean)</li>

<li> Difference Variance (DV):
 This is a measure of the variance or spread of the differences in grey
 levels between pairs of pixels within the moving window. It quantifies
 the contrast variability between pixels, indicating texture smoothness
 or roughness.</li>

<li> Sum Variance (SV):
 In contrast to Difference Variance, Sum Variance measures the variance
 of the sum of grey levels of pixel pairs. It assesses the variability
 in the intensity levels of pairs of pixels, contributing to an
 understanding of texture brightness or intensity variation.</li>
</ul>

Note that measures "mean", "kurtosis", "range", "skewness", and "standard
deviation" are available in <em>r.neighbors</em>.

<h3>Second-order statistics in the spatial domain</h3>

The second-order statistics texture model is based on the so-called grey
level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM; after Haralick 1979).

<ul>
<li> Angular Second Moment (ASM, also called Uniformity):
 This is a measure of local homogeneity and the opposite of Entropy.
 High values of ASM occur when the pixels in the moving window are
 very similar.
 <br>
 Note: The square root of the ASM is sometimes used as a texture measure,
 and is called Energy.</li>

<li> Inverse Difference Moment (IDM, also called Homogeneity):
 This measure relates inversely to the contrast measure. It is a direct measure of the
 local homogeneity of a digital image. Low values are associated with low homogeneity
 and vice versa.</li>

<li> Contrast (CON):
 This measure analyses the image contrast (locally gray-level variations) as
 the linear dependency of grey levels of neighboring pixels (similarity). Typically high,
 when the scale of local texture is larger than the <em>distance</em>.</li>

<li> Correlation (COR):
 This measure  analyses the linear dependency of grey levels of neighboring
 pixels. Typically high, when the scale of local texture is larger than the
 <em>distance</em>.</li>

<li> Information Measures of Correlation (MOC):
 These measures evaluate the complexity of the texture in terms of the
 mutual dependence between the grey levels of pixel pairs. They
 quantify how one pixel value informs or correlates with another,
 offering insight into pattern predictability and structure regularity.</li>

<li> Maximal Correlation Coefficient (MCC):
 This statistic measures the highest correlation between any two
 features of the texture, providing a single value that summarizes the
 degree of linear dependency between grey levels in the texture. It's
 often used to assess the overall correlation in the image, indicating
 how predictable the texture patterns are from one pixel to the
 next.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The computational region should be set to the input map with
<b>g.region raster=&lt;input map&gt;</b>, or aligned to the input map
with <b>g.region align=&lt;input map&gt;</b> if only a subregion
should be analyzed.

<p>
Note that the output of <em>r.texture</em> will always be smaller than
the current region as only cells for which there are no null cells and
for which all cells of the moving window are within the current region
will contain a value. The output will thus appear cropped at the margins.

<p>
Importantly, the input raster map cannot have more than 255 categories.

<h3>Performance</h3>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Calculation of Angular Second Moment of B/W orthophoto (North Carolina data set):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=ortho_2001_t792_1m -p
# set grey level color table 0% black 100% white
r.colors ortho_2001_t792_1m color=grey
# extract grey levels
r.mapcalc "ortho_2001_t792_1m.greylevel = ortho_2001_t792_1m"
# texture analysis
r.texture ortho_2001_t792_1m.greylevel output=ortho_texture method=asm -s
# display
g.region n=221461 s=221094 w=638279 e=638694
d.shade color=ortho_texture_ASM_0 shade=ortho_2001_t792_1m
</pre></div>

This calculates four maps (requested texture at four orientations):
ortho_texture_ASM_0, ortho_texture_ASM_45, ortho_texture_ASM_90, ortho_texture_ASM_135.

Reducing the number of gray levels (equal-probability quantizing):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region -p raster=ortho_2001_t792_1m

# enter as one line or with \
r.quantile input=ortho_2001_t792_1m quantiles=16 -r | r.recode \
           input=ortho_2001_t792_1m output=ortho_2001_t792_1m_q16 rules=-
</pre></div>

The recoded raster map can then be used as input for <em>r.texture</em> as before.

<p>
Second example: analysis of IDM (homogeneity) on a simple raster with
North-South line pattern.

<div class="code"><pre>
# import raster
r.in.ascii in=- output=lines &lt;&lt; EOF
north: 9
south: 0
east: 9
west: 0
rows: 9
cols: 9
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
EOF

# adjust region to raster
g.region raster=lines

# calculate IDM (homogeneity) in all directions
r.texture -s lines method=idm output=text_lines
</pre></div>

<p>
The following image shows the original map, the result in East-West direction
and the result in North-South direction, showing how texture can depend on
direction, with texture perfectly homogeneous (value=1) in the North-South
direction, but quite heterogeneous in East-West direction, except for those
areas where there are three columns of equal values (as size=3).
The overlaid grid highlights that the texture measures output maps
are cropped at the margins.
