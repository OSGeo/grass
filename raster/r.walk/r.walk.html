<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.walk</em> outputs 1) a raster map layer showing the lowest
cumulative cost of moving between each cell and the user-specified
starting points and 2) a second raster map layer showing the movement 
direction to the next cell on the path back to the start point (see 
<a href="#move">Movement Direction</a>). It uses an input elevation 
raster map layer whose cell category values represent elevation, 
combined with a second input raster map layer whose cell values 
represent friction costs.

This function is similar to <em>r.cost</em>, but in addiction to a
friction map, it considers an anisotropic travel time due to the
different walking speed associated with downhill and uphill movements.
<p>
The formula from Aitken 1977/Langmuir 1984 (based on Naismith's rule
for walking times) has been used to estimate the cost parameters of
specific slope intervals:

<p>T= [(a)*(Delta S)] + [(b)*(Delta H uphill)] + [(c)*(Delta H moderate downhill)] + [(d)*(Delta H steep downhill)]
<p>where:<br>
T is time of movement in seconds,<br>
Delta S is the distance covered in meters,<br>
Delta H is the altitude difference in meter.
<p> 

The a, b, c, d parameters take in account movement speed in the different
conditions and are linked to:

<ul>
  <li>a: underfoot condition (a=1/walking_speed)</li>
  <li>b: underfoot condition and cost associated to movement uphill</li>
  <li>c: underfoot condition and cost associated to movement moderate downhill</li>
  <li>d: underfoot condition and cost associated to movement steep downhill</li>
</ul>

It has been proved that moving downhill is favourable up to a specific
slope value threshold, after that it becomes unfavourable. The default
slope value threshold (slope factor) is -0.2125, corresponding to
tan(-12), calibrated on human behaviour (&gt;5 and &lt;12
degrees: moderate downhill; &gt;12 degrees: steep downhill). The
default values for a, b, c, d are those proposed by Langmuir (0.72, 6.0,
1.9998, -1.9998), based on man walking effort in standard
conditions.<p>
The lambda parameter of the linear equation combining movement and
friction costs:<br>

total cost = movement time cost + (lambda) * friction costs<br>
must be set in the option section of <em>r.walk</em>.
<p>
For a more accurate result, the "knight's move" option can be used
(although it is more time consuming). In the diagram below, the center
location (O) represents a grid cell from which cumulative distances
are calculated. Those neighbours marked with an x are always
considered for cumulative cost updates. With the "knight's move"
option, the neighbours marked with a K are also considered.

<div class="code"><pre>
  K   K 
K x x x K
  x O x
K x x x K
  K   K
</pre></div>

<p>The minimum cumulative costs are computed using Dijkstra's
algorithm, that find an optimum solution (for more details see
<em>r.cost</em>, that uses the same algorithm).
<a name="move"></a>
<h2>Movement Direction</h2>
<p>The movement direction surface is created to record the sequence of
movements that created the cost accumulation surface. Without it 
<em>r.drain</em> would not correctly create a path from an end point 
back to the start point. The direction of each cell points towards 
the next cell. The directions are recorded as degrees CCW from East:
<div class="code"><pre>
       112.5      67.5         i.e. a cell with the value 135 
157.5  135   90   45   22.5    means the next cell is to the north-west
       180   x   360           
202.5  225  270  315  337.5
       247.5     292.5
</pre></div>

<p>
Once <em>r.walk</em> computes the cumulative cost map as a linear
combination of friction cost (from friction map) and the altitude and
distance covered (from the digital elevation model), <em>r.drain</em>
can be used to find the minimum cost path. Make sure to use the <b>-d</b> flag
and the movement direction raster map when running r.drain to ensure
the path is computed according to the proper movement directions.
