/*********************************************************************
 * GRASS program to create a raster map with non-zero data
 *         in random locations.
 * Locations will be within non-zero data in the input layer.
 *        (unless -z option specified)
 * If it necessary to restrict the locations to only some categories
 *    of the input map, a reclass map should be constructed first
 *    and used as input to this program.
 *
 * Number of random cells can be a fixed number or a percentage of cells.
 *
 * Resulting raster map consists of original cell values at the selected
 *         random locations and zero elsewhere.
 *
 * A sitefile may optionally be created.
 *
 * Usage:
 *  r.random [-iqz] input=name [raster_output=name] [sites_output=name] n=n[%]
 *
 *    -i mean report number of total cells and null cells
 *    -q means run quietly
 *    -z means generate random locations for zero-data as well
 *
