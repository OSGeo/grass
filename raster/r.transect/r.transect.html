<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This program outputs, in ASCII, the values in a raster map
which lie along one or more user-defined transect lines.
The transects are described by their starting coordinates,
azimuth, and distance. 

<!-- The transects may be single-cell
 wide lines, or multiple-cell wide lines.  The output, for
 each transect, may be the values at each of the cells, or a
 single aggregate value (e.g., average or median value). -->
<p>
The <b>line</b> parameter is a definition of (each) transect line,
specified by the geographic coordinates of its starting point (<em>easting,
northing</em>), the angle and direction of its travel (<em>azimuth</em>),
and its distance (<em>distance</em>).

<p>The <em>azimuth</em> is an angle, in degrees, measured to
the east of north.  The <em>distance</em> is in map units
(meters for a metered database, like UTM).
<p>The <b>null</b> parameter can optionally be set to change the character
string representing null values.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

This program is a front-end to the <em>
<a href="r.profile.html">r.profile</a></em> program.  It simply converts the
azimuth and distance to an ending coordinate and then runs <em>
<a href="r.profile.html">r.profile</a></em>.

There once were <b>width=</b> and <b>result=</b><em>raw|median|average</em>
 options which are not currently implemented.
