<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program outputs, in ASCII, the values in a raster map
which lie along one or more user-defined transect lines.
The transects are described by their starting coordinates,
azimuth, and distance. 

<!-- The transects may be single-cell
 wide lines, or multiple-cell wide lines.  The output, for
 each transect, may be the values at each of the cells, or a
 single aggregate value (e.g., average or median value). -->
<P>

The <B>line</B> parameter is a definition of (each) transect line,
specified by the geographic coordinates of its starting point (<EM>easting,
northing</EM>), the angle and direction of its travel (<EM>azimuth</EM>),
and its distance (<EM>distance</EM>).

<P>
The <EM>azimuth</EM> is an angle, in degrees, measured to
the east of north.  The <EM>distance</EM> is in map units
(meters for a metered database, like UTM).
<P>
The <B>null</B> parameter can optionally be set to change the character
string representing null values.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

This program is a front-end to the <EM>
<A HREF="r.profile.html">r.profile</A></EM> program.  It simply converts the
azimuth and distance to an ending coordinate and then runs <EM>
<A HREF="r.profile.html">r.profile</A></EM>.

There once were <B>width=</B> and <B>result=</B><EM>raw|median|average</EM>
 options which are not currently implemented.
