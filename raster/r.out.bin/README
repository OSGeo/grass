Usage:
 r.out.bin [-i] input=name output=name [null=value]

Flags:
  -i   Output integer category values, not cell values

Parameters:
   input   Name of an existing raster map
  output   Name of an output binary map (use out=- for stdout)
    null   Value to write out for null
           default: 0

This program is derived from r.out.ascii with a few modifications.

If exported data is moved between platforms byte swapping
may be required.

The exported data can be converted to netCDF GMT format with
xyz2grd .... -ZTLf -F

TODO:
- Add optional fixed size header (1024) with region specs.
- Add byte swapping export routine.

--------------------
The source for r.out.bin which writes a binary array to
standard output. The source is taken from r.out.ascii with a few minor
changes. Depending on the data type the program will output a integer,
float, or double array, unless "-i" is specified, then it will be forced
to integer. The region parameters are printed to stderr. This file is
compatible with the generic mapping tools (GMT) program xyz2grd if the
user wants to convert to netCDF.
