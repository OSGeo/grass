<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
The module <em>r.stream.snap</em> is a supplementary module for
<em><a href="r.stream.extract.html">r.stream.extract</a></em> and
<em><a href="r.stream.basins.html">r.stream.basins</a></em> to correct
the position of outlets or stream initial points as they do not lie on 
the streamlines.

<p>
For the outlet, the point is snapped to the nearest point which lies on 
the streamline. 

<p>
For the stream initial points, when there is a small tributary near 
the main stream, the accumulation threshold shall be high enough to 
force the program ignoring this tributary and snap to the main stream. 
If there is no accumulation map, the points will be snapped to the 
nearest stream line, which in particular situations may be wrong. 
Because the <em>r.stream.*</em> modules are prepared to work with MFD 
accumulation maps, both stream network and accumulation map are 
necessary.

<p>
While it is assumed that the accumulation map is a MFD map, if the
stream network is not supplied, the snap point is calculated in
different way: the threshold is used to select only those points in the
search radius which have accumulation value greater than the given
threshold. The next mean value of these points is calculated and its
value is taken as a new threshold. This procedure guarantees that
points are snapped to the center of the stream tube. While for inits 
small thresholds are in use, it is probable that points were snapped to 
the stream tube border instead of its center.

<p>
It is strongly recommended to use both stream network (even
pre-generated with small accumulation threshold) and accumulation
raster map, than accumulation or stream raster map only.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>stream_rast</b></dt>
<dd>Stream network created
by <em><a href="r.stream.extract.html">r.stream.extract</a></em> or
<em><a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a></em>. If used, the
points are snapped to the nearest streamline point whose accumulation
is greater than the threshold. If the accumulation is not used, the 
point is snapped to the nearest stream.
</dd>

<dt><b>accumulation</b></dt>
<dd>Accumulation map created with 
<em><a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a></em> and used to
generate the stream network with 
<em><a href="r.stream.extract.html">r.stream.extract</a></em>. If
the stream network is not used, the point is adaptively snapped to the
point where the value is greater than mean values of accumulation
greater than given threshold in a search radius. See the description for
details.
</dd>

<dt><b>radius</b></dt>
<dd>Search radius (in cells). If there are no streams in the search
radius, the point is not snapped. If there are no cells with
accumulation greater than accumulation threshold, the point also is
not snapped.
</dd>

<dt><b>threshold</b></dt>
<dd>Minimum value of accumulation to snap the point. This option is 
added to the snap stream inits to the stream tubes
and to distinguish between local tributaries and main streams.
</dd>

<dt><b>input</b></dt>
<dd>Vector file containing outlets or inits as vector points. Only
point's categories are used. Any table attached to it is
ignored. Every point shall have its own unique category.
</dd>

<dt><b>output</b></dt>
<dd>Vector file containing outlets or inits after snapping. On layer 1,
the original categories are preserved, on layer 2 there are four
categories which mean:
<ol>
<li>skipped (not in use yet)
<li>unresolved (points remain unsnapped due to lack of streams in search radius
<li>snapped (points snapped to streamlines)
<li>correct (points which remain on their original position, which were
originally corrected)
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

# snap a point sampled in the riverine landscape to the calculated river network
