<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This module performs adaptive, edge-preserving raster smoothing
using anisotropic diffusion. The result is a denoised raster that
retains important features, especially edges. Unlike traditional
smoothing methods (such as a uniform average filter, like the one available
in <em>r.neighbors</em>), this module smooths only areas with similar values
and works to preserve sharp transitions between different regions.
An example is provided in the picture below: "A" is the original and
"B" is the smoothed version.</p>

<p>The module supports three types of diffusivity (conductance) functions:
<ul>
    <li>Exponential</li>
    <li>Quadratic <em>(both as proposed by Perona & Malik, 1990)</em></li>
    <li>Tukey’s biweight <em>(as proposed by Black et al., 1998)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The Tukey’s biweight function is more aggressive than the others and
tends to produce large, smoothly blended areas. This makes it
particularly useful for raster segmentation. If you prefer a gentler
effect that preserves smaller features, you can use the <em>-p</em> flag,
which switches to a softer variant of the Tukey function — ideal for
applications like visualization.</p>

<h3>PARAMETERS</h3>

<ul>
    <li><em>threshold</em>
    Defines how small a difference in raster values should be treated as
    noise. The unit depends on the raster (e.g., digital numbers, meters,
    etc.), and should be adjusted individually for each map.</li>
    <li><em>lambda</em>
    Controls the smoothing rate.
    <ul>
        <li>For <em>exponential</em> and <em>quadratic</em> functions,
        the value is automatically clamped between <em>0</em> and
        <em>0.25</em> for numeric stability.</li>
        <li>For <em>Tukey</em>, the full range is used.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><em>steps</em>
    Specifies the number of smoothing iterations. Higher values result
    in stronger smoothing. Note that:
    <ul>
        <li>Excessive iterations can cause loss of fine detail.</li>
        <li>Detail preservation improves in this order:
        <em>quadratic</em> → <em>exponential</em> → <em>Tukey</em> →
        <em>Tukey</em> with <em>-p</em> flag.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>Internally calculations are performed in double precision and only at the end
converted to the same type as the input map.</p>

<p>The module will try to keep all temporary data in RAM. Thus it is important
to set the <em>memory</em> parameter as high as possible. If the map does
not fit into RAM, a temporary file will be used instead.</p>

<p>The original Perona & Malik paper uses von Neumann (4-connected) neighbourhood for
value calculation, but this module uses Moore (8-connected) neighbourhood.
Computed gradients of neighbouring cells are adjusted to equalise distances for
diagonals and non-square cells.</p>

<div><pre class="code">
# Set computational region to orthophoto map

# Smooth with median in a 3x3 window. Although better than average smoothing,
# thin lines still are lost and noise on streets and roofs is still present.
r.neighbors input=ortho_2001_t792_1m output=ortho_smoothed_med \

# Smooth with aggressive Tukey's diffusivity function. Better preservation of
