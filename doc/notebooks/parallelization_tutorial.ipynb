    "Multithreading in C tools:\n",
    "   * Threads have low overhead, so they can be spawned more efficiently.\n",
    "   * Tools use OpenMP API. One of the advantages of OpenMP for software distribution is that code works (compiles and runs in serial) also without OpenMP library present on the system.\n",
    "   * Memory is shared, so programmer needs to be cautious about race conditions (e.g., writing into the same variable).\n",
    "   \n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python tools:\n",
    "   * There are multiple ways to implement it, typically tools use `subprocess` and `multiprocessing` package.\n",
    "   * Python tools are often wrappers around GRASS tools implemented in C. For example, tool [r.sun.daily](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/addons/r.sun.daily.html) runs [r.sun](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.sun.html) for multiple days in parallel.\n",

Effectively, tiling is applied virtually (using computational region), determining the spatial extent of analysis for each parallel process. In some cases such as moving window analysis, tiles need to overlap to get correct results.
