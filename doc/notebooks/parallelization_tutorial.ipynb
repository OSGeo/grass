    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Generally, there are two types of implementation.\n",
    "Multithreading in C tools:\n",
    "   * Threads have low overhead, so they can be spawned more efficiently.\n",
    "   * Tools use OpenMP API. One of the advantages of OpenMP for software distribution is that code works (runs in serial) also without OpenMP library present on the system.\n",
    "   * Memory is shared, so programmer needs to be cautious about race conditions (e.g., writing into the same variable).\n",
    "   \n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python tools:\n",
    "   * There are multiple ways to implement it, typically tools use `subprocess` and `multiprocessing` package.\n",
    "   * Python tools are often wrappers around GRASS tools implemented in C. For example, tool [r.sun.daily](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/addons/r.sun.daily.html) runs [r.sun](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.sun.html) for multiple days in parallel.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Parallelized tools have `nprocs` parameter to specify number of cores to use. For C tools using OpenMP, GRASS GIS needs to be compiled with OpenMP support to take advantage of it. Both implementations work well on a single machine, but can't be scaled to a distributed system.\n",

Effectively, tiling is applied virtually, determining the spatial extent of analysis for each parallel process. In some cases such as moving window analysis, tiles need to overlap to get correct results. Note that GridModule can be fairly inefficient due to the overhead from merging results back and is therefore best suited for computationally-itensive tasks such as interpolation."
