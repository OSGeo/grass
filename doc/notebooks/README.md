## Introduction

### Using the notebooks locally

Clone this repository with `git clone` first. Then, locally start the Jupyter notebook
server from the command line in the `doc/notebooks/` directory containing the `*.ipynb` files with:
`jupyter notebook`

This will open a new browser tab or window with a list of the contents of the current
working directory. Clicking on one of the `*.ipynb` files will start the notebook.

See also the official documentation for [The Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
