HOWTO document in this GRASS version?

- source code docs: use doxygen style 
  example: lib/proj/
           other libs

- modules:
   - write a file 'description.html' (see other modules for how to do that)
   - you can add figures (PNG format), the figure name prefix
     should be the module name

- header information: auto-generated
   The header information is automatically added during the build
   process. You can generate the header HTML to stdout by running 
   the module with the --html-description qualifier:
     g.module --html-description

- see also this script:  tools/build_html_index.html

- The Programmers' manual can by created from the inline Doxygen comments with:
     make htmldocs (or)
     make pdfdocs
