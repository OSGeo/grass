# Notebooks

## Introduction

### Using the notebooks locally

Clone this repository with `git clone` first. Then, locally start the Jupyter
notebook server from the command line in the `doc/examples/notebooks/`
directory containing the `*.ipynb` files with: `jupyter notebook`

This will open a new browser tab or window with a list of the contents of the
current working directory. Clicking on one of the `*.ipynb` files will start
the notebook.

See also the official documentation for
[The Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
