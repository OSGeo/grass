    "# GRASS in Jupyter Notebook with Python and grass.jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a quick introduction to *GRASS* in a *Jupyter Notebook* using the [_grass.jupyter_](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/libpython/grass.jupyter.html) package and the *Python* scripting language. The _grass.jupyter_ package simplifies the launch of *GRASS* in *Jupyter Notebook* and provides several useful classes for creating, displaying, and saving *GRASS* maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _grass.jupyter_ package was initially written as part of Google Summer of Code in 2021 by Caitlin Haedrich and was experimentally included in version 8.0.0. Caitlin further improved it thanks to the GRASS Mini Grant 2022. The package was officially released for the first time as part of version 8.2.0. If you are curious about how the package improves the integration of *GRASS* and *Jupyter Notebooks*, compare it with [scripting_example.ipynb](scripting_example.ipynb). More features of the _grass.jupyter_ package are presented in [jupyter_tutorial.ipynb](jupyter_tutorial.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples here are using a sample GRASS dataset for North Carolina, USA. The interactive notebook is available online thanks to the [*Binder*](https://mybinder.org/) service. If you are using the notebook in this environment, the dataset is already included.\n",

    "When using _GRASS_ through Python in a notebook, we usually find GRASS Python packages first, import them, and then initialize GRASS session:"
