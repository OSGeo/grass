== GRASS Source code repository ==

Maintainer: Markus Neteler, Martin Landa, OSGeo-SAC, http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC

Important update April 2019: The source code is now managed on GitHub (rather than in SVN).
The new GitHub repositories are:

* GRASS GIS core (7.x): https://github.com/OSGeo/grass
* GRASS GIS legacy (3.x-6.x): https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-legacy
* GRASS GIS Add-ons: https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons
* GRASS GIS promotional material: https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-promo
* GRASS GIS Website (future site): https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-website 

* Github mirror at OSGeo: https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/grass_gis/grass
* Git usage: https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/HowToGit

Still trac at OSGeo is used for tickets: https://trac.osgeo.org/grass

For easier linking in the Trac Wiki, some macro definitions are used for manual page refs (G7:modulename)
* https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/InterMapTxt

ZIP file download support in trac (was needed for g.extension) - on trac.osgeo.org:
/var/www/trac/grass/conf/trac.ini
[browser]
downloadable_paths = /grass-addons/grass7/*/*,/sandbox/*/*

== GRASS Web server ==

Maintainer: M. Neteler

* https://grass.osgeo.org  (to be replaced in 2020, see https://staging.grass.osgeo.org/)
** Shared virtual OSGeo machine (osgeo6) hosted at Oregon State University Open Source Lab
   (server: osgeo6.osgeo.osuosl.org)
** new server 2020: LXD container on osgeo7
** OSGeo SAC page: http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC_Service_Status
    http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/SAC
** Login: via OSGeo LDAP, there is a "grass" LDAP group
** Software:
*** OS: Debian Wheezy
*** Apache Server with PHP

* Backup:
** VERIFY 2010: grass.osgeo.org is backup'ed by OSGeo SAC: http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC:Backups
** Wiki backup, via rsync to http://josef.fsv.cvut.cz/WIKI/grass-osgeo/index.php/Main_Page
** new server 2020: LXD container on osgeo7 backup'ed

* Web pages:
** CMSMS: https://grass.osgeo.org/home/imprint/ (to be phased out in 2020 with hugo solution)
** OLD mirrored from Wroclav university via httrack (tier-1),
   then offered as rsync mirror (tier-2) to other mirror sites
** RSS feed: offered by CMSMS

* Weekly snapshots (generated Saturday morning California time):
** Source code tarball of git (GitHub) https://github.com/OSGeo/grass
** Linux binary snapshot is compiled
*** GRASS is compiled with GDAL, PROJ, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, FFTW, C++ support
*** binary tar.gz and manuals are moved into Web space

* GRASS user manual HTML:
** generated during compilation of weekly Linux binary snapshot

* GRASS programmer's manual (https://grass.osgeo.org/programming7/)
** HTML: cronjob run Wednesday morning California time
** HTML: cronjob run Saturday morning California time
** disabled: PDF: cronjob run Saturday morning California time

* i18N translation statistics (https://grass.osgeo.org/development/translations/#statistics)
** generated during compilation of Linux binary snapshot, stats of
   (cd locale; make) are extracted into text file
** text file parsed by PHP page and shown as table
** GRASS version is coded in devel/i18n_stats.inc

* Mailman mailing lists + greylisting (at lists.osgeo.org since 11/2007)
** Mailman is doing the job, only registered users can post
** messages from unsubscribed people is auto-discarded without notification
** the open "weblist" operates instead like this:
    User -> grass-web at lists osgeo.org -> greylisting -> Mailman

* Backup of mailing lists (mbox files)
** manually done by MN 
** nightly backup at OSGeo.org, bacula
** TODO: Establish solution via local cp on lists.osgeo.org (SAC ticket todo)

* Web statistics
** See URL at http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Project_Stats
** OSGeo: awstats (https://grass.osgeo.org/stats/awstats.pl)
*** configuration at: /etc/awstats/awstats.grass.osgeo.org.conf
***                   /etc/httpd/conf.d/sites/grass.osgeo.org.conf
***                   /etc/apache2/includes/grass.osgeo.org.inc
*** httpd logs: /var/log/httpd/grass_*
*** awstats processed log files: /osgeo/download/logs   - https://grass.osgeo.org/stats/
*** cronjob script: /osgeo/scripts/update_logs.sh
** OLD FBK Mirror: Webalizer (http://grass.fbk.eu/webalizer/) runs daily as cronjob
** OLD: Sitemeter: http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&s=s24grassgis

Summary: The system should run almost autonomously.

== GRASS CI: GitHub Actions ==

Started Apr. 2020

Maintainer: Vaclav Petras

* https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/actions
* Details: https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/pull/525

- CI workflow with:
  - A build job which is not parallelized and is meant for clear & relatively fast check of compilation and building in general. (Duplicating what is running on Travis)
  - A test job which of course needs to build, but the main focus is to run tests, so the compilation is parallelized (depending on nproc) and thus potentially less readable. This runs the whole test suite. (You need to run it locally to see the actual error, but you can see which tests are failing.)
- Static code analysis/Code quality check using Flake8 with separate tests for lib/python, gui/wxpython, scripts and temporal directories.
  - lib/python uses configuration which ignores code in testsuite directories and ignores a lot of errors.
  - The other directories use the default settings and the failure is ignored. (Neither is an ideal solution, but we can see and change it based on whatever is more advantageous for getting it fixed.)
