    - OS: Debian GNU/Linux 11 bullseye
    - Apache Server with Hugo (<https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-website>)
  - for migration details (7/2020), see <https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-website/issues/180>
  - ssh login: via jumphost hop.osgeo8.osgeo.org
  - deployment via cronjob: <https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons/tree/grass8/utils/cronjobs_osgeo_lxd/>

- <https://old.grass.osgeo.org> (CMSMS, replaced in 2020 by above Hugo based solution)

  - a static copy of the old site is found at
    `neteler@grasslxd:old-grass-website/old.grass.osgeo.org/` (13 GB)
  - otherwise: <https://web.archive.org/web/20191220035849/https://grass.osgeo.org/>

- Backups:

  - osgeo8-grass + wiki: container on osgeo8 is backup'ed,
    see <https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC:Backups>

- Mirrors:

  - rsync, see <https://grass.osgeo.org/contribute/> --> Mirror

- RSS feed: offered by Hugo at <https://grass.osgeo.org/index.xml>, used at <https://planet.osgeo.org>

- Weekly software snapshots (generated Saturday morning Portland (OR), US time):

  - Source code tarball of git (GitHub) <https://github.com/OSGeo/grass>
  - Linux binary snapshot is compiled on osgeo8-grass
    - GRASS is compiled with GDAL, PROJ, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, FFTW, C++ support,
      see <https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons/tree/grass8/utils/cronjobs_osgeo_lxd/>
    - binary tar.gz and manuals are moved into Web space

- GRASS user manual HTML:

  - generated during compilation of weekly Linux binary snapshot on osgeo8-grass

- Mailman mailing lists + automated greylisting
  (at <https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo>, since 11/2007)

  - Mailman is doing the job, only registered users can post
  - messages from unsubscribed people is auto-discarded without notification
  - the open "weblist" operates instead like this:
    - mails goes to grass-web at lists osgeo.org -> greylisting -> Mailman
    - for greylisting, see <https://postgrey.schweikert.ch/>
    - Moderation of queue: <https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/admindb/grass-web>

- Backup of mailing lists (mbox files)

  - nightly backup at OSGeo.org, bacula

- Web statistics
  - Matomo: <https://2022.foss4g.org/matomo/> (not publicly accessible;
    access: Markus Neteler)
  - Selected stats: <https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Project_Stats> and <https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/VisibilityStats#Mailing_list_subscribers>

Summary: The system should run almost autonomously.

  - Linux log files: <https://grass.osgeo.org/addons/grass8/logs> (compiled on
    `grasslxd` on `osgeo8`)
  - Windows log files: <https://wingrass.fsv.cvut.cz/grass8X/addons/grass-XXXdev/logs/>

Procedure of granting write access to Addons repo:

- Request procedure: <https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/blob/main/doc/development/submitting/submitting.md>
- Adding OSGeo-ID: <https://www.osgeo.org/community/getting-started-osgeo/osgeo_userid/>
- Adding contributor: <https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass-addons/contributors.csv>

## GRASS CI: GitHub Actions

Started in Apr. 2020

Maintainer: Vaclav Petras

- <https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/actions>
- Details: <https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/pull/525>
- CI workflow with:
  - A build job which is not parallelized and is meant for clear & relatively fast
    check of compilation and building in general. (Duplicating what is running
    on Travis)
  - A test job which of course needs to build, but the main focus is to run tests,
    so the compilation is parallelized (depending on nproc) and thus potentially
    less readable. This runs the whole test suite. (You need to run it locally to
    see the actual error, but you can see which tests are failing.)
- Static code analysis/Code quality check using Flake8 with separate checks for
  python/grass, gui/wxpython, scripts and temporal directories.
  - Configurations ignore different lists of Flake8 errors. The idea is to reduce
    that to minimum.
  - Code in testsuite directories is also ignored for now, but should not be in
    the future.

## GRASS docker images

Maintainer: Carmen Tawalika, Vaclav Petras + OSGeo-SAC

Docker images are created with a GitHub action. Subsequently, login is done
to DockerHub using `docker/login-action` with username and password through
CI secrets and the images pushed to Docker hub at:

- <https://hub.docker.com/r/osgeo/grass-gis/>

User settings:

- The GRASS GIS CI user at Docker hub is "grassgis" (joined June 3, 2023),
  see also <https://hub.docker.com/u/grassgis>
- Docker Hub access token are managed via <grass-ci-admin@osgeo.org>.
- The OSGeo Org membership is managed at <https://hub.docker.com/orgs>
  through OSGeo-SAC

## GRASS Zenodo.org repository: citable source code with DOI

Zenodo page with DOI (for all versions, shows latest release on top):
[10.5281/zenodo.5176030](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5176030)

**GitHub - Zenodo Integration**: The settings are accessible with any
GitHub account which has write access to the GRASS GIS GitHub repo and
they are managed here:

<https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/repository/OSGeo/grass>

In the settings, the GRASS GIS GitHub repository needs to be enabled.

Upcoming releases should automatically show up and get a DOI
assigned.

Explanations: <https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GitHub-Zenodo_linkage>

## GRASS Coverity Scan

Maintainer: Markus Neteler

Coverity Scan is a service to find security issues. At time the service
is used only occasionally.

- <https://scan.coverity.com/projects/grass?tab=overview>

## User message translation management (i18N)

Messages are extracted with `gettext` message macros.

Translations may be done using the OSGeo Weblate platform:

- Weblate: <https://weblate.osgeo.org/>
  - GRASS GIS Weblate server: <https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/grass-gis/>

Anyone with OSGeo-LDAP access can work on the translations.

For technical background and access rights of the Weblate installation,
see <https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC:Weblate>.

### How Weblate works

When a developer makes a GRASS GIS repo commit on GitHub, GitHub then calls
the webhook on Weblate which triggers a refresh of Weblate's git copy of the
GRASS GIS repo.

For pushing translations back to GitHub, there is a setting in Weblate for that
which defaults to 24 hrs (accumulates translations over a day). Then a pull
request with the translations will be opened in the GRASS GIS GitHub repo.

### Weblate troubleshooting

In case the Weblate's git copy of the GRASS GIS repo does not update due to
a conflict or whatever reason:

Log into Weblate (requires administrator rights) and switch to
<https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/grass-gis/#repository>. Therein click on
"Manage" -> "Repository Maintenance", choose the "Update" button,
"Update with merge without fast-forward". If successful, this will create
another pull request in the GRASS GIS repo (trigger with "Push" button).
