## GRASS Web server

    * grasslxd: LXD container on osgeo7 (https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC_Service_Status#osgeo7)
        * OS: Debian Buster
        * Apache Server with hugo
    * for migration details (7/2020), see https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-website/issues/180
    * ssh login: via osgeo jumphost
    * deployment via cronjob: https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons/tree/master/tools/cronjobs_osgeo_lxd
* https://old.grass.osgeo.org (CMSMS, replaced in 2020 by hugo based solution)
    * Shared virtual OSGeo machine (osgeo6) hosted at Oregon State University Open Source Lab
   (server: osgeo6.osgeo.osuosl.org)
    * Login: via OSGeo LDAP, there is a "grass" LDAP group
    * Software:
        * OS: Debian Wheezy
        * Apache Server with PHP
    * Login: via OSGeo LDAP, there is a "grass" LDAP group
* Backup:
    * grasslxd container on osgeo7 is backup'ed, see http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC:Backups
    * Wiki backup, via rsync to http://josef.fsv.cvut.cz/WIKI/grass-osgeo/index.php/Main_Page
* Mirrors:
    * rsync, see https://grass.osgeo.org/contribute/
    * mirror list, see https://grass.osgeo.org/about/mirrors/
* RSS feed: offered by hugo at https://grass.osgeo.org/index.xml, used at https://planet.osgeo.org

* Weekly software snapshots (generated Saturday morning California time):
    * Source code tarball of git (GitHub) https://github.com/OSGeo/grass
    * Linux binary snapshot is compiled on grasslxd
        * GRASS is compiled with GDAL, PROJ, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, FFTW, C++ support
        * binary tar.gz and manuals are moved into Web space

* GRASS user manual HTML:
    * generated during compilation of weekly Linux binary snapshot on grasslxd

* GRASS addons manual HTML:
    * generated during compilation of weekly Linux binary snapshot on grasslxd

* GRASS programmer's manual (https://grass.osgeo.org/programming8/)
    * HTML: cronjob run Wednesday morning California time
    * HTML: cronjob run Saturday morning California time
    * disabled: PDF: cronjob run Saturday morning California time

* i18N translation statistics (https://grass.osgeo.org/development/translations/#statistics)
    * generated during compilation of Linux binary snapshot, stats of `(cd locale; make)` are extracted into text file
    * text file parsed by PHP page and shown as table
    * GRASS GIS version is coded in devel/i18n_stats.inc
    * for Transifex integration, see below

* Mailman mailing lists + greylisting (at lists.osgeo.org since 11/2007)
    * Mailman is doing the job, only registered users can post
    * messages from unsubscribed people is auto-discarded without notification
    * the open "weblist" operates instead like this:
        * User -> grass-web at lists osgeo.org -> greylisting -> Mailman

* Backup of mailing lists (mbox files)
    * nightly backup at OSGeo.org, bacula

* Web statistics
    * See URL at http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Project_Stats
        * cronjob script: /osgeo/scripts/update_logs.sh

Summary: The system should run almost autonomously.

    * Linux log files:   https://grass.osgeo.org/addons/grass7/logs (compiled on `grasslxd` on `osgeo7`)
    * Windows log files: http://wingrass.fsv.cvut.cz/grass78/x86_64/addons/latest/logs/

## GRASS CI: GitHub Actions

Started Apr. 2020

Maintainer: Vaclav Petras

* https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/actions
* Details: https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/pull/525

* CI workflow with:
    * A build job which is not parallelized and is meant for clear & relatively fast check of compilation and building in general. (Duplicating what is running on Travis)
    * A test job which of course needs to build, but the main focus is to run tests, so the compilation is parallelized (depending on nproc) and thus potentially less readable. This runs the whole test suite. (You need to run it locally to see the actual error, but you can see which tests are failing.)
* Static code analysis/Code quality check using Flake8 with separate checks for python/grass, gui/wxpython, scripts and temporal directories.
    * Configurations ignore different lists of Flake8 errors. The idea is to reduce that to minimum.
    * Code in testsuite directories is also ignored for now, but should not be in the future.
