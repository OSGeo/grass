# How to release GRASS GIS binaries and source code

## Assumptions

- You have communicated with other developers, e.g., through grass-dev mailing list.
- You have communicated with a development coordinator.
- You have evaluated status of issues and PRs associated with the relevant milestone.
- You have already cloned the repo with Git.
- Your own fork is the remote called "origin".
- The OSGeo repo is the remote called "upstream".
- You don't have any local un-pushed or un-committed changes.
- You are using Bash or a similar shell.

*Note: Some later steps in this text are to be done by the development coordinator
(currently Markus Neteler and Martin Landa) due to needed logins.*

## Prepare the local repo

Update your remotes and switch to branch:

```bash
git fetch --all --prune && git checkout releasebranch_8_2
```

Confirm that you are on the right branch and have no local changes
and that you have no local unpushed commits:

```bash
# Should show no changes:
git status
# Should give no output at all:
git diff
git diff --staged
# Should give no output:
git log upstream/releasebranch_8_2..HEAD
# Should give the same as last commits visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now you can merge (or rebase) updates from the remote your local branch
and optionally update your own fork:

```bash
git merge upstream/releasebranch_8_2 && git push origin releasebranch_8_2
```

Verify the result:

```bash
# Should give no output:
git log upstream/releasebranch_8_2..HEAD
# Should give the same as last commits visible on GitHub:
git log --max-count=5
```

Now or any time later, you can use `git log` and `git show` to see the latest
commits and the last commit including the changes.

```bash
git log --max-count=5
git show
```

## Update VERSION file to release version number

Modify the VERSION file use the dedicated script, for RC1, e.g.:

```bash
./utils/update_version.py status
./utils/update_version.py rc 1
```

The script will compute the correct version string and print a message containing it into the terminal (e.g., "version: GRASS GIS 8.2.0RC1").

Commit with a commit message suggested by the script, e.g.:

```bash
git diff
git commit include/VERSION -m "version: GRASS GIS 8.2.0RC1"
```

Check that there is exactly one commit on your local branch and that it is the version change:

```bash
git status
git show
```

Push the tag to the upstream repo:

```bash
git push upstream
```

## Create variables

For convenience, create Bash variables with the version update script:

```bash
# Get VERSION and TAG as variables.
eval $(./utils/update_version.py status --bash)
```

Version and tag are the same for all releases:

```bash
echo "$VERSION"
echo "$TAG"
```

If in doubt, run the script without `eval $(...)` to see all the variables created.

## Create release tag

The tag is created locally, while the release draft is created automatically by
GitHub Actions and can be later edited on GitHub. For background on GitHub releases,
see: <https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases>.

### Tag release

Before creating the tag, it is a good idea to see if the CI jobs are not failing.
Check on GitHub or use GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh run list --branch releasebranch_8_2
```

Some time was needed to run the checks, so before getting back to creating the tag,
confirm that you are on the right branch which is up to date:

```bash
git status
git log --max-count=5
```

Create an annotated tag (a lightweight tag is okay too, but there is more metadata
stored for annotated tags including a date; message is suggested by the version script):

```bash
git tag $TAG -a -m "GRASS GIS 8.2.0RC1"
```

List all tags (annotated will be at the top of both lists):

```bash
git tag -n --sort=-creatordate
git tag -n --sort=-taggerdate
```

Now push the tag upstream - this will trigger the automated workflows linked to tags:

```bash
git push upstream $TAG
```

If any of the tag-related jobs fails, open an issue and see what you can do manually
so that you can continue in the release process.

### Create release notes

Generate a draft of release notes using a script. The script the script needs to
run from the top directory and will expect its configuration files
to be in the _utils_ directory.

For major and minor releases, GitHub API gives good results for the first
release candidate because it contains contributor handles and can identify
new contributors, so use with the _api_ backend, e.g.:

```bash
python ./generate_release_notes.py api releasebranch_8_2 8.0.0 $VERSION
```

For micro releases, GitHub API does not give good results because it uses PRs
while the backports are usually direct commits without PRs.
The _git log_ command operates on commits, so use use the _log_ backend:

```bash
python ./generate_release_notes.py log releasebranch_8_2 8.2.0 $VERSION
```

In between RCs and between last RC and final release, the _log_ backend is useful
for showing updates since the last RC:

```bash
python ./generate_release_notes.py log releasebranch_8_2 8.2.0RC1 $VERSION
```

For the final release, the changes accumulated since the first RC need to be
added manually to the result from the _api_ backend.

The script sorts them into categories defined in _utils/release.yml_.
However, these notes need to be manually edited to collapse related items into one.
Additionally, a _Highlights_ section needs to be added with manually identified new
major features for major and minor releases. For all releases, a _Major_ section
may need to be added showing critical fixes or breaking changes if there are any.

### Modify the release draft

After the automated release job completes, a new release draft will be available in the GitHub
web interface. You can copy-paste the created release notes to GitHub and further modify as needed.

Older release description may or may not be a good inspiration:
<https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/releases>.

If RC, mark it as a pre-release, check:

```
[x] This is a pre-release
```

Save the modified draft, but do not publish the release yet.

## Reset include/VERSION file to git development version

Use a dedicated script to edit the VERSION file.

After an RC, switch to development version:

```bash
./utils/update_version.py dev
```

After a final release, switch to development version for the next micro, minor, or major
version, e.g., for micro version, use:

```bash
./utils/update_version.py micro
```

Use _major_ and _minor_ operations for the other version updates.
Use `--help` for details about the options.

Commit with the suggested commit message and push, e.g.:

```bash
git show
git commit include/VERSION -m "version: Back to 8.2.0dev"
git push upstream
```

## Upload to OSGeo servers

This part requires extra permissions and needs to be done by one of the development coordinators.

### Get the tagged version

For the automation, the tagged version of the source code is needed.
First, update the repo to get the tag locally:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

Get the tagged source code, e.g.:

```bash
git checkout 8.2.0RC1
```

Create the Bash variables for version numbers:

```bash
eval $(./utils/update_version.py status --bash)
```

Confirm the version (it should match exactly the tag specified above):

```bash
echo "$VERSION"
```

### Get changelog file for upload

There is also a large changelog file we produce and publish,
fetch the file from the release which was generated by a workflow
linked to the tag:

```bash
wget https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/releases/download/${VERSION}/ChangeLog.gz -O ChangeLog_${VERSION}.gz
```

### Get the source code tarball

Fetch a tarball from GitHub we also publish on OSGeo servers:

```bash
wget https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/archive/${VERSION}.tar.gz -O grass-${VERSION}.tar.gz
md5sum grass-${VERSION}.tar.gz > grass-${VERSION}.md5sum
```

### Upload source code tarball to OSGeo servers

Note: servers 'osgeo8-grass' and 'osgeo7-download' only reachable via
      jumphost (managed by OSGeo-SAC) - see https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC_Service_Status#grass

```bash
# Store the source tarball (twice) in (use scp -p FILES grass:):
USER=neteler
SERVER1=osgeo8-grass
SERVER1DIR=/var/www/code_and_data/grass$MAJOR$MINOR/source/
SERVER2=osgeo7-download
SERVER2DIR=/osgeo/download/grass/grass$MAJOR$MINOR/source/
echo $SERVER1:$SERVER1DIR
echo $SERVER2:$SERVER2DIR

# upload along with associated files:
scp -p grass-$VERSION.* AUTHORS COPYING ChangeLog_$VERSION.gz \
  INSTALL REQUIREMENTS.html CONTRIBUTING.md $USER@$SERVER1:$SERVER1DIR

scp -p grass-$VERSION.* AUTHORS COPYING ChangeLog_$VERSION.gz \
  INSTALL REQUIREMENTS.html CONTRIBUTING.md $USER@$SERVER2:$SERVER2DIR

# Only at full release (i.e., not for RCs)!
# generate link to "latest" source code
ssh $USER@$SERVER1 "cd $SERVER1DIR ; rm -f grass-$MAJOR.$MINOR-latest.tar.gz"
ssh $USER@$SERVER1 "cd $SERVER1DIR ; ln -s grass-$VERSION.tar.gz grass-$MAJOR.$MINOR-latest.tar.gz"
ssh $USER@$SERVER1 "cd $SERVER1DIR ; rm -f grass-$MAJOR.$MINOR-latest.md5sum"
ssh $USER@$SERVER1 "cd $SERVER1DIR ; ln -s grass-$VERSION.tar.md5sum grass-$MAJOR.$MINOR-latest.md5sum"

# verify
echo "https://grass.osgeo.org/grass$MAJOR$MINOR/source/"
```

## Update winGRASS related files

Update the winGRASS version at <https://github.com/landam/wingrass-maintenance-scripts/>:

```bash
vim wingrass-maintenance-scripts/grass_packager_release.bat
vim wingrass-maintenance-scripts/grass_addons.sh
vim wingrass-maintenance-scripts/grass_copy_wwwroot.sh
vim wingrass-maintenance-scripts/cronjob.sh       # major/minor release only
```

## Update addon builders

Add the new version to repos which build or test addons:

- https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons/blob/grass8/.github/workflows/ci.yml (currently, for new branches only)
- https://github.com/landam/wingrass-maintenance-scripts/blob/master/grass_addons.sh (add new release related line for new branches and final releases)

## Close milestone

For a final release (not release candidate), close the related milestone at
<https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/milestones>.
If there are any open issues or PRs, move them to another milestone
in the milestone view (all can be moved at once).

## Publish the release

When the above is done and the release notes are ready, publish the release at
<https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/releases>.

Release is done.

## Improve release description

For final releases only, go to Zenodo a get a Markdown badge for the release
which Zenodo creates with a DOI for the published released.

For all releases, click the Binder badge to get Binder to build. Use it to test it and
to cache the built image. Add more links to (or badges for) more notebooks if there
are any which show well specific features added or updated in the release.
