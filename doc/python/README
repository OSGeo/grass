There are two ways of using Python to run GRASS commands:
 (or you could mix them together)

- Module scripting using the grass python helper library and g.parser.
    import grass.script as gs
  For examples see scripts/ in the GRASS 7 source code.


- Module creation using hooks into the C library functions using ctypes.
  The scripts in the doc/python/examples/ directory will describe this.
  (Ctypes is standard in Python 2.5 and newer; replaces the SWIG
  implementation in GRASS)


More details can be found in the GRASS Programmer's Manual.
