# This configuration should work for all Python library, Python scripts and
# wxPython GUI.
# Example for gui/wxpython:
#   pylint --rcfile=../../tools/pylintrc.txt -f parseable -r n -i y lmgr/

# A lot of errors need to be ignored now to avoid a large number of messages.
# Files need to be fixed one by one (partialy without this configuration).


[MASTER]

# Specify a configuration file.
#rcfile=

# Python code to execute, usually for sys.path manipulation such as
# pygtk.require().
#init-hook=

# Profiled execution.

# Add files or directories to the blacklist. They should be base names, not
# paths.
ignore=CVS

# Pickle collected data for later comparisons.
persistent=no

# List of plugins (as comma separated values of python modules names) to load,
# usually to register additional checkers.

[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Enable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can
# either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time.
#enable=

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where
# it should appear only once).

# E1103: caused probably by wxPython
# W0613: unused arg -> solve somewhere here using event
# C0103: names not defined
# W0201: define methods used for init
# W0622: Redefining built-in %r: needs complex solution

# E1101: %s %r has no %r member: why?
# R0201: can be solved
# F0401: somthing is possible to import only in grass
