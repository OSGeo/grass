o GRASS text mode startup

  "grass" starts up g.gui by default (if not first time user).
  "grass --text" will start up in text mode.
  "grass --gtext" will start up with graphical welcome screen but continue then in text mode.
  "grass --gui" will start up in wxpython mode.

  You can set an alias "grass" to e.g. "grass --text" to use text mode by default.
  Or set the environmental variable GRASS_GUI=text.

  See grass --help or the command's manual page for more details
  about invocation.
