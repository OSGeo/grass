<!-- meta page description: GRASS GIS Quickstart -->

<p>
When <a href="grass.html">launching</a> GRASS GIS for the first time, you will open a
<b>default project</b> "world_latlog_wgs84" where you can find a map layer
called "country_boundaries" showing a world map in the WGS84 coordinate system.

The main component of the Data tab is the <em>Data Catalog</em>
which shows the GRASS GIS hierarchical structure consisting of
database <img src="grassdb.png" alt="[GRASS Database]">,
project <img src="location.png" alt="[project]"> and
mapset <img src="mapset.png" alt="[mapset]">.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><img src="grassdb.png" alt="[GRASS Database]">&nbsp;<b>GRASS database</b> (directory with projects)</dt>
  <dd>Running GRASS GIS for the first time, a folder named "grassdata" is automatically
    created. Depending on your operating system, you can find it in your $HOME
    directory (*nix) or My Documents (MS Windows).</dd>
  <dt><img src="location.png" alt="[project]">&nbsp;<b>project</b> (previously called location)</dt>
  <dd>A project is defined by its coordinate reference system (CRS).
    In the case of the default project, it is a geographic coordinate reference system
    WGS84 (EPSG:4326). If you have data in another CRS than WGS84, you should create
    a new project corresponding to your system.</dd>
  <dt><img src="mapset.png" alt="[mapset]">&nbsp;<b>mapset</b> (a subproject)</dt>
  <dd>Each project can have many mapsets for managing different aspects of
    a project or project's subregions. When creating a new project, GRASS GIS
    automatically creates a special mapset called PERMANENT where the core
    data for the project can be stored.</dd>

<h2>GRASS started in the default project, now what?</h2>

<p>
First, if you would like to get to know GRASS better before importing your own data,
please download provided samples such as the &quot;North Carolina&quot; dataset.
You can simply reach them through
&quot;Download sample project to current database&quot; management icon
<img src="location-download.png" alt="[Download project]">.
</p>

<p>
To work with your own data, you typically want to first create a new project
with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system">
coordinate reference system (CRS)</a> suitable for your study area or one that
matches your data's CRS. The Project Wizard <img src="location-add.png" alt="[Add project]">
will help you with that by guiding you through a series of dialogs to browse
and select predefined projections (also via EPSG code) or to define individual
projections.

<h3>Creating a New project with the Project Wizard</h3>
<p>
If you know the CRS of your data or study area,
you can fill <a href="https://epsg.io">EPSG code</a>
or description and Project Wizard finds appropriate CRS from a predefined list
of projections.

If you do not know CRS of you data, you can read it from your georeferenced
data file (e.g. shapefile or GeoTiff file with the related metadata properly
included).
</p>

<h3>Importing data</h3>
After creating a new project, you are ready to import your data. You can use
simple raster or vector data import <img src="raster-import.png" alt="[Raster import]">,
<img src="vector-import.png" alt="[Vector import]"> or a variety of more specialized tools.
If the data's CRS does not match your project's CRS, data will be automatically reprojected.

After import your raster or vector data are added as a layer to Map Display.
To change layer properties, go to Display tab.
To analyze your data, search for a tool in the Modules tab.

<h2>Text-based startup and project creation</h2>

GRASS GIS can be run entirely without using the graphical user interface.
See <a href="grass.html">examples</a> of running GRASS GIS from a command line.
