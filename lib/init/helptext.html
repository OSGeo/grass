<h2>Geographic Resources Analysis Support System</h2>

GRASS GIS, commonly referred to as GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis
Support System), is a free Geographic Information System (GIS) software
used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing,
graphics/maps production, spatial modeling, and visualization. GRASS GIS
is currently used in academic and commercial settings around the world,
as well as by many governmental agencies and environmental consulting
companies. GRASS GIS is an official project of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (OSGeo).

<h2>1. Graphical startup of GRASS GIS</h2>

<i>For text-based startup see below.</i>
<p>
Compared to previous versions of GRASS, the concept of starting has completely
changed in version 8. You will no longer find the graphical startup screen in
this version. The Data tab, which takes care of organizing data, will become
your new friend.
</p>
<p>
After first GRASS GIS <a href="grass7.html">launch</a>, you will come to the
<b>default Location</b>. This prepared template contains a map layer called "country_boundaries"
showing a world map in WGS84 coordinate system:
</p>
 
<center>

</center>

<br>
<p>
The main component of the Data tab is the Data Catalog. It uses a unique hiearchical
structure consisting of Database <img src="grassdb.png" alt="[GRASS Database]">,
Location <img src="location.png" alt="[Location]"> and Mapset <img src="mapset.png" alt="[Mapset]">.
This concept of data organization is deeply rooted in the GRASS philosophy and
you will meet it every time - does not matter whether you prefer a graphical
user interface or a command line.
</p>
<p>
For better idea, these terms will be further explained on the example of the <b>default Location</b>.
</p>

<h2>2. Background: Data organization in GRASS</h2>

<h3><img src="grassdb.png" alt="[GRASS Database]">&nbsp;GRASS Database</h3>

The first time you run GRASS, a folder named "grassdata" is automatically
created in your home directory. This folder called DATABASE
represents your GRASS working directory.

<h3><img src="location.png" alt="[Location]">&nbsp;Location (a project)</h3>

A LOCATION is defined by its coordinate reference system (CRS).
In the case of the default LOCATION, it is a geographic coordinate reference system
WGS84 (EPSG:4326). If you have data in another CRS than WGS84, you should create
a new LOCATION corresponding to our system. In short, each CRS stays
in its own LOCATION. Within each LOCATION, a mandatory "PERMANENT"
MAPSET exists which contains projection information and some more
definitions.

<h3><img src="mapset.png" alt="[Mapset]">&nbsp;Mapset (a subproject)</h3>

<p>Each LOCATION can have many MAPSETS that consist of MAPS.
One motivation to maintain different MAPSETS is to store maps
related to project issues or subregions. Another motivation is to
support simultaneous access of several users to the map layers
stored within the same LOCATION, i.e. teams working on the same
project. For teams, a centralized GRASS DATABASE  would be defined
in a shared network file system (e.g. NFS). Besides access to his/her own
MAPSET, each user can also read map layers in other users' MAPSETS,
but can modify or remove only the map layers in their own MAPSET.
</p>
<p>
The default Location has only one special Mapset called PERMANENT which is
always automatically created with a new Location.
</p>

<h4>The role of the "PERMANENT" Mapset</h4>
<p>
When creating a new LOCATION, GRASS GIS automatically creates a special
MAPSET called PERMANENT where the core data for the project can be
stored. Data in the PERMANENT MAPSET can only be added, modified or
removed by the owner of the PERMANENT MAPSET; however, they can be
accessed, analyzed, and copied into their own MAPSET by the other
users. The PERMANENT MAPSET is useful for providing general spatial
data (e.g. an elevation model), accessible but write-protected to all
users who are working in the same LOCATION as the database owner.
To manipulate or add data to PERMANENT, the owner would start
GRASS and choose the relevant LOCATION and the PERMANENT MAPSET. This
mapset also contains the DEFAULT_WIND file, which holds the default
region boundary coordinate values for the LOCATION (which all users
will inherit when they start using the database). Additionally, in
all mapsets a WIND file is kept, for storing the current boundary 
coordinate values and the currently selected raster resolution. Users
have the option of switching back to the default region at any time.
</p>
<p>
You can learn more about mapsets and how to seamlessly access maps
found in another MAPSET of the same LOCATION in the
<a href="g.mapsets.html">g.mapsets</a> documentation.
</p>

<h2>3. GRASS started in the default Location, now what?</h2>
<p>
First, if you would like to get know GRASS better before importing your own data,
please download provided samples such as the &quot;North Carolina&quot; or the
&quot;Spearfish&quot; dataset. You can simply reach them through
"Download sample location to current database" management icon
<img src="location-download.png" alt="[Download Location]">.
Another way is to download the compressed data package(s) from
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/</a>
and extract them into a database directory.
</p>
<p>
If you want to continue straight with your own data, it is essential to realize
what coordinate system they are in. If you have your data in another CRS than
the default Location has, you need to create a new Location corresponding to
your data through <img src="location-add.png" alt="[Add Location]">.
The Location Wizard will help you with that.

<h3>3.1. Creating a New Location with the Location Wizard</h3>
<p>
The <a href="wxGUI.html">wxGUI</a> graphical user interface provides a
graphical "Location Wizard" which lets you easily create a
new LOCATION for own data. You will be guided through a series of dialogues to
browse and select predefined projections (also via EPSG code) or to
define individual projections. The rules to define the raster resolution as
described above also apply here.
</p>
<p>
You can also create a new LOCATION easily from a georeferenced data file
(e.g., SHAPE file or GeoTIFF file with the related metadata properly included).
In this case you are asked whether the data itself should be imported
into the new LOCATION. The default region is then set to match imported map.
</p>

<h3>3.2. Importing data</h3>
After creating a new Location, you are ready to import your data. You can use
simple raster or vector data import <img src="raster-import.png" alt="[Raster import]">,
<img src="vector-import.png" alt="[Vector import]"> or variety of more specialized features.

To change imported layer properties, go to Display tab.
To analyze your data, search for a module (tool) in the Modules tab.

<h2>5. Text-based startup and location creation</h2>

GRASS GIS can be run entirely without using the graphical user interface.
For a first time startup, the following steps have to be followed:

<ol>
<li> Create the GRASS GIS database directory (with a file manager; or on command line: <tt>mkdir /home/user/grassdata</tt></li>
<li> Create a new location, including it's default PERMANENT mapset,
     without entering the new location:
<ul>
    <li>Using an EPSG code:<br>
        &nbsp;<tt>grass79 -e -c EPSG:32630 /home/user/grassdata/mylocation</tt></li>
    <li>Using a georeferenced raster or vector file:<br>
        &nbsp;<tt>grass79 -e -c MyGeoReferenceFile.tif /home/user/grassdata/mylocation</tt></li>
</ul></li>
<li> Create new mapset within the new location and launch GRASS GIS within
     that mapset: <br>
        &nbsp;<tt>grass79 -c /home/user/grassdata/mylocation/mymapset</tt>
</ol>
