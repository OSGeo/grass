<h2>GRASS GIS startup</h2>

<p>
When <a href="grass7.html">launching</a> GRASS GIS for the first time, you will open a
<b>default Location</b> "world_latlog_wgs84" where you can find a map layer
called "country_boundaries" showing a world map in the WGS84 coordinate system.
</p>

<p>
The main component of the Data tab is the <em>Data Catalog</em>
which shows the GRASS GIS hierarchical structure consisting of
Database <img src="grassdb.png" alt="[GRASS Database]">,
Location <img src="location.png" alt="[Location]"> and
Mapset <img src="mapset.png" alt="[Mapset]">.
These terms will be further explained on the example
of the <b>default Location</b>.
</p>

<h2>Background: Data organization in GRASS</h2>

<h3><img src="grassdb.png" alt="[GRASS Database]">&nbsp;GRASS Database</h3>

Running GRASS GIS the first time, a folder named "grassdata" is automatically
created. Depending on your operating system, you can find it in your $HOME
directory (*nix) or My Documents (MS Windows).

<h3><img src="location.png" alt="[Location]">&nbsp;Location (a project)</h3>

A Location is defined by its coordinate reference system (CRS).
In the case of the default Location, it is a geographic coordinate reference system
WGS84 (EPSG:4326). If you have data in another CRS than WGS84, you should create
a new Location corresponding to your system.

<h3><img src="mapset.png" alt="[Mapset]">&nbsp;Mapset (a subproject)</h3>

<p>Each Location can have many Mapsets for managing different aspects of
a project or project's subregions. When creating a new Location, GRASS GIS
automatically creates a special Mapset called PERMANENT where the core
data for the project can be stored.
</p>
<p>
For more info about data hierarchy, please have a look at the GRASS GIS website:
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass79/manuals/grass_database.html">
https://grass.osgeo.org/grass79/manuals/grass_database.html</a>.
</p>


<h2>GRASS started in the default Location, now what?</h2>
<p>
First, if you would like to get to know GRASS better before importing your own data,
please download provided samples such as the &quot;North Carolina&quot; or the
&quot;Spearfish&quot; dataset. You can simply reach them through
&quot;Download sample location to current database&quot; management icon
<img src="location-download.png" alt="[Download Location]">.
</p>

<p>
To work with your own data, you can typically want to first create a new Location
with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system">
coordinate reference system (CRS)</a> suitable for your study area or one that
matches your data's CRS. The Location Wizard <img src="location-add.png" alt="[Add Location]">
will help you with that by guilding you through a series of dialogues to browse
and select predefined projections (also via EPSG code) or to define individual
projections.

<h3>Creating a New Location with the Location Wizard</h3>
<p>
If you know CRS of your data, you can fill <a href="https://epsg.io">EPSG code</a>
or description and Location Wizard finds appropriate CRS from a predefined list
of projections.

If you do not know CRS of you data, you can read it from your georeferenced
data file (e.g. shapefile or GeoTiff file with the related metadata properly
included).
</p>

<h3>Importing data</h3>
After creating a new Location, you are ready to import your data. You can use
simple raster or vector data import <img src="raster-import.png" alt="[Raster import]">,
<img src="vector-import.png" alt="[Vector import]"> or a variety of more specialized features.

To change imported layer properties, go to Display tab.
To analyze your data, search for a module (tool) in the Modules tab.


<h2>Text-based startup and location creation</h2>

GRASS GIS can be run entirely without using the graphical user interface.
The examples of running GRASS from a command line are available here:
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass78/manuals/grass7.html">
https://grass.osgeo.org/grass78/manuals/grass7.html</a>.
