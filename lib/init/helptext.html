=======
See the "Location Wizard"&nbsp;<img src="circle_4.png" alt="[(4)]"> to
easily create a new LOCATION from scratch from a geocoded file, by
defining the parameters or by selecting the corresponding EPSG projection
code.
<p>
See&nbsp;<img src="circle_5.png" alt="[(5)]"> to directly download a
sample LOCATION into the DATABASE. 

<h3><img src="circle_3.png" alt="[(3)]">&nbsp;Selecting the MAPSET (a subproject)</h3>

Each LOCATION can have many MAPSETs. Each MAPSET is a LOCATION's
subdirectory. New MAPSET can be added at GRASS startup (see related
button).

<h3><img src="circle_4.png" alt="[(4)]">&nbsp;Location Wizard</h3>

The "Location Wizard" let's you easily create a new LOCATION. You
will be guided through a series of dialogues to browse and select
predefined projections (also via EPSG code) or to define individual
projections. You can also create new LOCATION easily from a georeferenced
data file (e.g., SHAPE file or GeoTIFF, see below).  Find below also some
rules to define the default raster resolution for a new LOCATION.

<h3><img src="circle_5.png" alt="[(5)]">&nbsp;Download a sample LOCATION</h3>

In the "Location Wizard" there is also a Download button that allows you to
directly download a ready-to-use LOCATION into the DATABASE. You can
choose among different sample LOCATIONS that are currently available at the
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data/">Download</a>
section in the GRASS GIS website.

<h3><img src="circle_6.png" alt="[(6)]">&nbsp;Start GRASS</h3>

Once you have selected an existing LOCATION/MAPSET or defined a new
one, you can enter GRASS. The graphical user interface 
<a href="wxGUI.html">wxGUI</a> will open and provide you with a
menu system, map visualization tool, digitizer, and more.


<h2>2. Background: GRASS GIS Location structure</h2>

A LOCATION is simply a set of directories which contains the GRASS
data of a project. Within each LOCATION, a mandatory "PERMANENT"
MAPSET exists which contains projection information and some more
definitions. It can be used to store the base cartography in it as
"PERMANENT" is visible to all users accessing a LOCATION.

<h3>Creating and maintaining MAPSETs</h3>
One motivation to maintain different MAPSETs is to store maps
related to project issues or subregions. Another motivation is to
support simultaneous access of several users to the map layers
stored within the same LOCATION, i.e. teams working on the same
project. For teams, a centralized GRASS DATABASE would be defined
in a shared network file system (e.g. NFS). Besides access to his/her own
MAPSET, each user can also read map layers in other users' MAPSETs,
but s/he can modify or remove only the map layers in his/her own
MAPSET.
<p>
You can learn more about mapsets and how to seamlessly access maps
found in another MAPSET of the same LOCATION in the
<a href="g.mapsets.html">g.mapsets</a> documentation.

<h3>The role of the "PERMANENT" MAPSET</h3>
When creating a new LOCATION, GRASS GIS automatically creates a special
MAPSET called PERMANENT where the core data for the project can be
stored. Data in the PERMANENT MAPSET can only be added, modified or
removed by the owner of the PERMANENT MAPSET; however, they can be
accessed, analyzed, and copied into their own MAPSET by the other
users. The PERMANENT MAPSET is useful for providing general spatial
data (e.g. an elevation model), accessible but write-protected to all 
users who are working in the same LOCATION as the database owner.
To manipulate or add data to PERMANENT, the owner would start
GRASS and choose the relevant LOCATION and the PERMANENT MAPSET.  This
mapset also contains the DEFAULT_WIND file, which holds the default
region boundary coordinate values for the LOCATION (which all users
will inherit when they start using the database). Additionally, in 
all mapsets a WIND file is kept, for storing the current boundary 
coordinate values and the currently selected raster resolution.  Users
have the option of switching back to the default region at any time.

<h2>3. Creating a GRASS Database with Sample Data</h2>

To create the GRASS database:

<ol>
<li> Find a place on your disk where you have write access and that
    has enough disk space to hold your spatial data.</li>
<li> Create a subdirectory that will hold the general GRASS database
    (e.g. using a file manager or with <tt>mkdir /data/grassdata</tt> or 
    <tt>mkdir /home/yourlogin/grassdata</tt>).</li>
</ol>

<h2>GRASS started in the default project, now what?</h2>

<p>
First, if you would like to get to know GRASS better before importing your own data,
please download provided samples such as the &quot;North Carolina&quot; dataset.
You can simply reach them through
&quot;Download sample project to current database&quot; management icon
<img src="location-download.png" alt="[Download project]">.

To work with your own data, you typically want to first create a new Location
with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system">
coordinate reference system (CRS)</a> suitable for your study area or one that
matches your data's CRS. The Location Wizard <img src="location-add.png" alt="[Add Location]">
will help you with that by guiding you through a series of dialogs to browse
and select predefined projections (also via EPSG code) or to define individual
projections.

<h3>Creating a New project with the Project Wizard</h3>
<p>
If you know the CRS of your data or study area,
you can fill <a href="https://epsg.io">EPSG code</a>
or description and Project Wizard finds appropriate CRS from a predefined list
of projections.

If you do not know CRS of you data, you can read it from your georeferenced
data file (e.g. shapefile or GeoTiff file with the related metadata properly
included).
</p>

<h3>Importing data</h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
After creating a new project, you are ready to import your data. You can use
simple raster or vector data import <img src="raster-import.png" alt="[Raster import]">,
<img src="vector-import.png" alt="[Vector import]"> or a variety of more specialized tools.
If the data's CRS does not match your project's CRS, data will be automatically reprojected.

>>>>>>> 4fcbd3f967 (Add Binder badge/button to readme (#1628))

After import your raster or vector data are added as a layer to Map Display.
To change layer properties, go to Display tab.
To analyze your data, search for a tool in the Modules tab.

<h2>Text-based startup and project creation</h2>

GRASS GIS can be run entirely without using the graphical user interface.
<<<<<<< HEAD
See <a href="grass.html">examples</a> of running GRASS GIS from a command line.
=======
For a first time startup, the following steps have to be followed:

<ol>
<li> Create the GRASS GIS database directory (with a file manager; or on command line: <tt>mkdir /home/user/grassdata</tt></li>
<li> Create a new location, including it's default PERMANENT mapset,
     without entering the new location:
<ul>
    <li>Using an EPSG code:<br>
        &nbsp;<tt>grass -e -c EPSG:32630 /home/user/grassdata/mylocation</tt></li>
    <li>Using a georeferenced raster or vector file:<br>
        &nbsp;<tt>grass -e -c MyGeoReferenceFile.tif /home/user/grassdata/mylocation</tt></li>
</ul></li>
<li> Create new mapset within the new location and launch GRASS GIS within
     that mapset: <br>
        &nbsp;<tt>grass -c /home/user/grassdata/mylocation/mymapset</tt>
</ol>
