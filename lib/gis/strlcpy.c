/**
 * \brief Safe string copy function.
 *
 * Copy string src to buffer dst of size dsize. At most dsize-1
 * characters will be copied. Always NUL terminates (unless dsize == 0).
 * This function is a safer alternative to strncpy.
 *
 * \param[out] dst Pointer to the destination buffer.
 * \param[in] src Pointer to the source string. Must be a NUL-terminated C
 *                string.
 * \param[in] dsize The size of the destination buffer.
 *
 * \return The total length of the string src (not including the terminating
 *         NUL character). If the return value is >= dsize, truncation occurred.
 *
 * \note If truncation occurred, the return value is the length of the string
 *       that would have been created if enough space had been available.
 *
 * \warning This function does not pad the destination buffer with NUL bytes
 *          if the source string is shorter than dsize-1 bytes, unlike strncpy.
 *
 * \warning The src string must be a valid NUL-terminated C string. Passing an
 *          unterminated string may result in buffer overrun.
