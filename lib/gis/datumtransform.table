# Datum Transformation Parameter Lists for GRASS
# (allows multiple different sets of datum transformation parameters to be
#  supplied for any datum)
#
# Line Format:
# shortname "parameters" "Where Used" "Comment"
#
# where
# * parameters can be in any format accepted by PROJ.4, 
#   so towgs84= 3 parameters or 7 parameters, or nadgrids=
# * area of validity
# * comment
# Hence, 4 fields on each line, and shortname should be already
# listed in datum.table.
#
# All but 1st field must be enclosed in quotes ("") An empty field can
# contain a single space between the quotes (" ") but try to provide as
# much detail as possible for the user.
#
# Note: datum.table only holds one 3-parameter transformation. Extra sets of 
# transformation parameters may be defined in this file for each datum
# and will be presented to the user to select the most appropriate one for
# his/her location. The "Where Used" and "Comment" fields should contain
# information to aid in the user's decision.
# If only the 7-parameter transformation is desired/known, set all 3 of
# the 3-term parameters in datum.table to be 99999, along with the correct
# ellipsoid.
#
# Any supplementary files needed by the PROJ.4 library (e.g. gridshift tables) 
# should be placed in the directory $GISBASE/etc/proj/nad/.
