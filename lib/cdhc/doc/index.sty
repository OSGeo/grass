%%%                        indexing macros to provide better support
%%%                        for indexing in LaTeX.  In particular, it
%%%                        provides:
%%%
%%%                        (a) Support for multiple indexes, which
%%%                        are declared using the \newindex and
%%%                        \renewindex commands.
%%%
%%%                        (b) A two-stage process for creating the
%%%                        raw index files (such as the default .idx
%%%                        file), similar to that used to create the
%%%                        .toc file.  That is, the index entries are
%%%                        first written to the .aux file, and then
%%%                        copied to the .idx file at the end of the
%%%                        run.  This means that if you have a large
%%%                        document consisting of several \include'd
%%%                        files, you no longer lose the index if you
%%%                        format only part of the document with
%%%                        \includeonly.
%%%
%%%                        (c) A *-variant of the \index command
%%%                        that, in addition to putting it's argument
%%%                        in the Index, also typesets it in the
%%%                        running text.
%%%
%%%                        (d) A \shortindexingon command that causes
%%%                        ^{foo} to be shorthand for \index{foo} and
%%%                        _{foo} to be shorthand for \index*{foo}
%%%                        (only outside of math mode, of course).
%%%                        These shorthands can be turned off with
%%%                        \shortindexingoff command.
%%%
%%%                        (e) The functionality of the showidx style
%%%                        option has been merged into this file.
%%%                        The command \proofmodetrue can be used to
%%%                        enable the printing of index entries in
%%%                        the margin of pages.  The size and style
%%%                        of font can be controlled with the the
%%%                        \indexproofstyle command.
%%%
%%%                        (f) The \index command has been rewritten
%%%                        to be more robust.  In particular, it no
%%%                        longer depends on \catcode changes to work
%%%                        properly, so the new \index command can be
%%%                        used in places that the original couldn't,
%%%                        such as inside the arguments of other
%%%                        macros.
%%%
%%%                        There is a sample file after the \endinput
%%%                        command.

%%%
%%%                        CAVEATS: In order to implement these
%%%                        improvements, it's been necessary to
%%%                        modify a number of LaTeX commands
%%%                        seemingly unrelated to indexing, including
%%%                        the following: \@starttoc, \raggedbottom,
%%%                        \flushbottom, \addcontentsline, \markboth,
%%%                        \markright.  Naturally, this could cause
%%%                        incompatibilities between index.sty and
%%%                        any style files that either redefine these
%%%                        same commands or make specific assumptions
%%%                        about how they operate.  See below for
%%%                        explanations of why these various commands
%%%                        needed modification.
%%%
%%%                        It's also been necessary to modify the
%%%                        \theindex environment, but I've tried to
%%%                        do so very conservatively.  If your style
%%%                        file uses \indexname, you should be ok.
%%%                        Otherwise, you'll have to redefine the
%%%                        \theindex environment yourself if you
%%%                        don't want the LaTeX book.sty default.
%%%
%%%                        TO DO: I really should rewrite this using
%%%                        doc.sty.  Also, it might be nice if the
%%%                        \index* command parsed it's argument so
%%%                        that, for example, you could say
%%%                        `\index*{sin@$\sin$}' as a synonym for
%%%                        `\index{sin@$\sin$}$\sin$'.  However, this
%%%                        fraught with numerous dangers and I'm both
%%%                        too lazy and too cowardly to undertake it
%%%                        now.
%%%
%%%                        Maybe it would be nice if this package were

%% The \newindex command is used to declare new indexes; the
%% \renewindex command is used to redefine existing indexes.  The
%% first argument is a short tag to be used to refer to the index.
%% The commands \index and \printindex are redefined to take an
%% optional argument, the tag of the index referred to.  Thus, if you
%% have defined an author index with the tag ``aut'', the command
%% \index[aut]{foo} will add an entry to the author index, and the
%% command \printindex[aut] will print the author index.  If the
%% optional argument is absent, the index with the tag ``default'' is
%% used.  (This normally corresponds to the usual index declared by
%% \makeindex.)  The second argument is the extension of the raw
%% index file where LaTeX should dump the unprocessed entries for
%% this index.  The third argument is the extension of the index file
%% where LaTeX will expect to find the processed index.  The fourth
%% argument is the name of the index.

%% Examples:
%%   \newindex{default}{idx}{ind}{\indexname} %equivalent to \makeindex
%%   \newindex{aut}{adx}{and}{Name Index}
%%   \newindex{not}{ndx}{nnd}{Index of Notation}

%% #1 = tag (default, author, notation, etc.)
%% #2 = extension (idx, adx, ndx, etc.) of the raw index file
%% #3 = extension of processed file (ind, and, nnd, etc.)

%% Now let's take some code from showidx.sty and merge it into our
%% new system.  There are three reasons for redefining the commands
%% here rather than just inputting showidx.sty (or requiring the user
%% to do so).  First, showidx.sty ends with a call to \flushbottom,
%% which I want to avoid.  Second, the instructions for successfully
%% using showidx.sty along with index.sty would be somewhat tricky.
%% This way, I can just tell users not to use showidx.sty at all.
%% (If I were feeling really paranoid, I could implement something
%% that would disable the showidx style option, but I won't.)  Third,
%% I need to make some alterations to \@showidx anyway.  In
%% particular, (a) I need to add the \@sanitizeat command so this
%% works correctly with AMS-LaTeX and (b) I want to add the
%% \indexproofstyle command so the user can customize the size and
%% font used for the index proofs.

%% Partly I'm just being silly here, but partly there's a good reason
%% for doing things this way.  I can't define \@sanitizeat directly,
%% since its definition requires @ to be active, and thus ineligible
%% to be part of a command name.  On the other hand, I don't want to
%% define something like \sanitizeat, since that's in the user's
%% namespace.  So, I use a temporary control sequence that is
%% unlikely to conflict with anything.

%% Now, this really gets up my nose.  The only way to make sure that

%% head again.  (Incidentally, it should be possible to use the
%% \@nearverbatim trick to make arguments of sectioning commands
%% robust.  I'll have to explore this.)
