This library contains routines called both by client and drivers.

The low level communication is in the xdr*.c files. The routines
All the xdr*.c files create and destroy and XDRS structure.
the xdr_destroy() calls fflush() on the FILE * which is necessary
for the communication along both pipes to work properly.

The client stubs are in c_*.c files.

The driver implementation for any routine, say db_xxxx() is
to be named db_driver_xxxx().

The drivers must write the db_driver_xxxx()
For example
	db_ls()        /* client routine */
	db_driver_ls() /* driver routine */

----------------------------------------------------------	
The following variables need to be supplied by gmake

XDRLIB:
    the library which contains the xdr_int(), et al routines
	sun:        none, seems that these are in -lc
	dg aviion:  none, seems that these are in -lc
	intergraph: XDRLIB = -lbsd
	linux0.99:  XDRLIB = -lrpclib
	mips:       XDRLIB = -lrpcsvc
	sgi:        XDRLIB = -lsun

USE_DIRECT:
    #define that says to use #include <sys/dir.h> and struct direct
    instead of #include <dirent.h> and struct dirent

	mips: USE_DIRECT = -DUSE_DIRECT

USE_BUFFERED_IO:
    #define that says to not to call setbuf(fd, NULL) to force unbuffered io

	sun:    USE_BUFFERED_IO = -DUSE_BUFFERED_IO
	mips:   USE_BUFFERED_IO = -DUSE_BUFFERED_IO
    note:
	intergraph, sgi won't work unless io is unbuffered.
	sun, mips can use buffered io.

CC:
	mips: CC = /bsd43/bin/cc

---------------
The $DBMSCAP file should have the remote-shell full path in the
command and not let $PATH handle it. 

	sun: /usr/ucb/rsh
	mips: /bin/net/rsh
	intergraph: /usr/bin/rcmd
	sgi: /usr/bsd/rsh
