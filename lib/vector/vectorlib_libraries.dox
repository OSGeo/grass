\section vlibsAboutIntro Introduction

Besides internal library functions there are two main libraries:

- Vlib (Vector library), see \ref vlibIntro
- DGLib (Directed Graph Library)

For historical reasons, there are two internal libraries:

- diglib (with dig_*() functions), GRASS 3.x/4.x
- Vlib (with V1_*(), V2_*() and Vect_*() functions), since GRASS 4.x
  (except for the 5.7 interim version)

The vector library was introduced in GRASS 4.0 to hide internal vector
files' formats and structures.  In GRASS 6/7, everything is accessed via
Vect_*() functions, for example:

Old 4.x code:

\code
    xx = Map.Att[Map.Area[area_num].att].x;
\endcode

New 6.x/7.x functions:

\code
    centroid = Vect_get_area_centroid(Map, area_num);
    Vect_read_line(Map, line_p, NULL, centroid);
    Vect_line_get_point(line_p, 0, &xx, NULL, NULL);
\endcode

In GRASS 6/7, all internal, mostly non-topological vector functions are
hidden from the modules' API (mainly dig_*(), V1_*() and V2_*()
functions). All available Vect_*() functions are topological vector
functions.


The following include file contains definitions and structures
required by some of the routines in this library. The programmer
should therefore include this file in any code that uses the vector
library:

\code
#include <grass/vector.h>
\endcode

\section vlibsHistory Historical notes

The vector library in GRASS 4.0 changed significantly from the
<em>Digit Library</em> (diglib) used in GRASS 3.1. Below is an
overview of why the changes were made.

The Digit Library was a collage of subroutines created for developing
the map development programs. Few of these subroutines were actually
designed as a user access library. They required individuals to assume
too much responsibility and control over what happened to the data
file. Thus when it came time to change vector data file formats for
GRASS 4.0, many modules also required modification. The two different
access levels for 3.0 vector files provided very different ways of
calling the library; they offered little consistency for the user.

The Digit Library was originally designed to only have one file open
for read or write at a time. Although it was possible in some cases to
get around this, one restriction was the global head structure. Since
there was only one instance of this, there could only be one copy of
that information, and thus, only one open vector file.

The solution to these problems was to design a new user library as an
interface to the vector data files. This new library was designed to
provide a simple consistent interface, which hides as much of the
details of the data format as possible. It also could be extended for
future enhancements without the need to change existing programs.

The new vector library in GRASS 4 provided routines for opening,
closing, reading, and writing vector files, as well as several support
functions. The Digit Library has been replaced, so that all existing
modules was converted to use the new library. Those routines that
existed in the Digit Library and were not affected by these changes
continue to exist in unmodified form, and were included in the vector
library. Most of the commonly used routines have been discarded, and
replaced by the new vector routines.

Instead the global head structure was used own local version of
it. The structure that replaced structure head is structure \ref
dig_head. There were still two levels of interface to the vector files
(future releases may include more). Level one provided access only to
arc (i.e. polyline) information and to the type of line (AREA, LINE,
DOT). Level two provided access to polygons (areas), attributes, and
network topology.
