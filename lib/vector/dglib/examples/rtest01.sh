# This test captures correctness of flattening/unflattening operations
# asserting that the input graph to ./unflatten be identical to its
# output.
# There are a number of implicit tests here:
# - When a graph is unflattened all information kept in the buffers
#   are moved to an avl-tree using gnGrpAddLink(). Link insertions
#   identical to those made by a user program are performed.
#   Before returning gnGrpUnflatten() destroys the buffers.
# - When flattening buffers are rebuilt from the avl-tree.
