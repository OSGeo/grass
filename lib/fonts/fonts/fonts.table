# Descriptive Names for GRASS Stroke Fonts
#
# This file maps a descriptive name to each font file, for use in the
# description field in the fontcap table (generated by g.mkfontcap).
#
# Format: Each line contains the filename followed by the vertical bar
# character | and then the descriptive name.
#
# Note that this file is used purely for the purpose of specifying
# descriptive names for the Stroke fonts in this directory.
# $GISBASE/etc/fontcap contains the list of fonts available to the GRASS
# display drivers, and any changes must be reflected there before they are
# available for use - g.mkfontcap can do this automatically.
