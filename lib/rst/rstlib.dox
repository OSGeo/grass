/*! \page rstlib GRASS Library for interpolation with regularized splines with tension

\tableofcontents


Including and linking
=====================

Include interpf.h, qtree.h and dataquad.h header files according
to which you need:

    #include <grass/interpf.h>
    #include <grass/qtree.h>
    #include <grass/dataquad.h>

Extend `LIBES` and `DEPENDENCIES` in your `Makefile` by the following:

    LIBES = $(INTERPFLLIB) $(GMATHLIB)
    DEPENDENCIES = $(INTERPFLDEP) $(GMATHDEP)

- IL_vector_input_data_2d()
- IL_create_bitmask()
- IL_resample_interp_segments_2d()
- IL_resample_output_2d()
- IL_output_2d()
