WHAT IS BWIDGET ?

The BWidget Toolkit is a high-level Widgets Set for Tcl/Tk built using
native Tcl/Tk 8.x namespaces.

The BWidgets have a professional look&feel as in other well known Toolkits 
(Tix or Incr Widget) but the concept is radically different because everything is 
native so no platform compilation, no compiled extension library are needed. 
The code is 100% Pure Tcl/Tk.
