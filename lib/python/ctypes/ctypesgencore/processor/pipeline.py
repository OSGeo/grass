"""
A brief explanation of the processing steps:
1. The dependencies module builds a dependency graph for the descriptions.

2. Operation functions are called to perform various operations on the
descriptions. The operation functions are found in operations.py.

3. If an operation function decides to exclude a description from the output, it
sets 'description.include_rule' to "never"; if an operation function decides not
to include a description by default, but to allow if required, it sets
'description.include_rule' to "if_needed".

4. If an operation function encounters an error that makes a description unfit
for output, it appends a string error message to 'description.errors'.
'description.warnings' is a list of warning messages that will be displayed but
will not prevent the description from being output.

5. Based on 'description.include_rule', calculate_final_inclusion() decides
which descriptions to include in the output. It sets 'description.included' to
True or False.

6. For each description, print_errors_encountered() checks if there are error
messages in 'description.errors'. If so, print_errors_encountered() prints the
error messages, but only if 'description.included' is True - it doesn't bother
the user with error messages regarding descriptions that would not be in the
output anyway. It also prints 'description.warnings'.

7. calculate_final_inclusion() is called again to recalculate based on
the errors that print_errors_encountered() has flagged.
