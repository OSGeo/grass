The openGL gsurf library (ogsf), consisting of approximately 20,000 lines 
of C code, contains some 180 public functions and about twice as many 
internal functions for run-time data storage, manipulation, querying, 
and visualization using OpenGL.
The library handles all drawing and lighting operations, including use of
user-defined clipping planes and drawing various style "fences" on clipping
planes when drawing multiple surfaces, and treats datasets as objects which
can be used for various attributes of the rendering.  It allows data 
sharing (e.g., same data for more than one attribute of same or different 
surfaces), separate masking for each surface, multiple surfaces, vector sets, 
or point sets, and will also allow multiple volumes.  The library provides 
all query features such as 3D "point on surface", keyframe animation routines, 
and full state saving functionality.  Database-specific routines for 
interfacing with the GRASS GISlib are kept isolated for easier library reuse 
with other databases.  The gsurf library is not dependent upon any particular 
interface library, and has been used successfully with both Motif and Tcl/Tk. 
It is used for NVIZ visualization tool.


moved from src.contrib/GMSL/NVIZ2.2/lobes/ogsf/ 
      to   src/libes/ogsf/

Updated src.contrib/GMSL/NVIZ2.2/Gmakefile for that.
