PyGRASS documentation
=====================

Python is a programming language which is more powerful than shell
scripting but easier and more forgiving than C. *PyGRASS* is an
object-oriented Python Application Programming Interface (API) for
GRASS GIS. *PyGRASS* offers interfaces to GRASS modules and
functionality, as well as to vector and raster data. For details,
see Zambelli et al. (2013) in the references below. *PyGRASS*
improves the integration between GRASS GIS and Python, making the
use of Python under GRASS more consistent with the language itself.
Furthermore, it simplifies GRASS scripting and programming and more
natural for the user.

Background: In 2006, GRASS GIS developers started to adopt Python
for the new GUI. Due to this Python became more and more important
and developers converted all shell scripts from GRASS GIS 6 to Python
for GRASS GIS 7.

To work with *PyGRASS* you need an up-to-date version of GRASS
GIS. The only action before starting to work with *PyGRASS* is
to launch GRASS GIS 8 and from the console launch *python* or
*ipython* (the second one is the recommended way).


Read more about how to work with *PyGRASS* in this documentation.
