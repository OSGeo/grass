# Setup translations
#
# The translations in the GRASS GIS Python package grass, GRASS Python modules
# (scripts), and the wxPython GUI (wxGUI) are handled as application translations,
# rather than Python module or package translations. This means that that translation
# function called `_` (underscore) is added to buildins namespace. When the grass
# package or any subpackage (or an object from there) is imported, the `_` function
# becomes available globally (i.e. for all Python code in the same process). This is
# the good part.

# Unfortunately, creating `_` in the global namespace has unitended consequences such
# as issues in interactive shells, with doctests, and it is conflicting with a common
# practice of using `_` for unused variables. This is the same behavior as with the
# common function `gettext.install()` which also adds `_` into the global namespace.
# The solution to this is to use the module translations approach instead of
# application translation approach. Without changing the overall approach, the current
# code can be modified to allow for using imports of translation functions instead of
# relying on the buildins when desired as a transitional state before removing the
# modification of buildins.
#
# The current code mitigates two other issues associated with `gettext.install()`
# approach: First, it delays initialization of translations to the time when they are
# needed instead of doing it during import time (and possibly failing when
# environmental variables pointing to the source file are not set properly). Second,
# it adds multiple domains as fallback unlike `gettext.install()` which simply uses
# the last used domain.
