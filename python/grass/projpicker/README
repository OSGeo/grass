ProjPicker (projection picker) is a Python module that allows the user to
select all coordinate reference systems (CRSs) whose extent completely
contains given points, polylines, polygons, and bounding boxes using
set-theoretic logical operators in a postfix notation.

projpicker.db is a SQLite database file that contains information about the
extents of coordinate reference systems (CRSs). It holds one table called bbox
whose schema is defined in _bbox_schema in common.py. This file can be
regenerated from the PROJ database file proj.db. The current database was
created using proj.db from pyproj 3.1.0.

To recreate projpicker.db, run the following command from the GRASS
installation directory in etc/python/grass:

python -c "import projpicker as ppik; ppik.create_projpicker_db(True)"
