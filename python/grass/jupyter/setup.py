    The session is ended when `session.finish` is called or when the object is
    destroyed when kernel ends or restarts. This function returns a copy of an
    internally kept reference, so the return value can be safely ignored when not
    needed.

    The returned object can be used to switch to another mapset:

    >>> session.switch_mapset("mapset_name")

    Subsequent calls to the *init* function result in switching the mapset if
    a session is active and result in creation of new session if it is not active.

    a GRASS module, you know you don't have an active GRASS session.
