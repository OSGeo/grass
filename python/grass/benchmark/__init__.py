"""Benchmarking for GRASS GIS modules

This subpackage of the grass package is experimental and the API can change anytime.
The API of the package is defined by what is imported in the top-level ``__init__.py``
file of the subpackage.

The functions in the Python API raise exceptions, although calls of other functions from
the grass package may call grass.script.fatal and exit
(see :func:`grass.script.core.set_raise_on_error` for changing the behavior).
This applies to the CLI interface of this subpackage too except that raised usage
exceptions originating in the CLI code result in *sys.exit* with an error message, not
traceback. Messages and other user-visible texts in this package are not translatable.
