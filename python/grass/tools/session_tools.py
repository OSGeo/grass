class Tools:
    """Use GRASS tools through function calls (experimental)

    GRASS tools (modules) can be executed as methods of this class.
    This API is experimental in version 8.5 and is expected to be stable in version 8.6.

    The tools can be used in an active GRASS session (this skipped when writing
    a GRASS tool):

    >>> import grass.script as gs
    >>> gs.create_project("xy_project")
    >>> session = gs.setup.init("xy_project")

    Multiple tools can be accessed through a single *Tools* object:

    >>> from grass.tools import Tools
    >>> tools = Tools(session=session)
    >>> tools.g_region(rows=100, cols=100)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ToolResult(...)
    >>> tools.r_random_surface(output="surface", seed=42)
    ToolResult(...)

    For tools outputting JSON, the results can be accessed directly:

    >>> print("cells:", tools.g_region(flags="p", format="json")["cells"])
    cells: 10000

    Resulting text or other output can be accessed through attributes of
    the *ToolResult* object:

    >>> tools.g_region(flags="p").text  # doctest: +SKIP

    Text inputs, when a tool supports standard input (stdin), can be passed as *io.StringIO* objects:

    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> tools.v_in_ascii(
    ...     input=StringIO("13.45,29.96,200"), output="point", separator=","
    ... )
    ToolResult(...)

    The *Tools* object can be used as a context manager:

    >>> with Tools(session=session) as tools:
    ...     tools.g_region(rows=100, cols=100)
    ToolResult(...)

    A tool can be accessed via a function with the same name as the tool.
    Alternatively, it can be called through one of the *run* or *call* functions.
    The *run* function provides convenient functionality for handling tool parameters,
    while the *call* function simply executes the tool. Both take tool parameters as
    keyword arguments. Each function has a corresponding variant which accepts a list
    of strings as parameters (*run_cmd* and *call_cmd*).
    When a tool is run using the function corresponding to its name, the *run* function
    is used in the background.

    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        session=None,
        env=None,
        overwrite=None,
        verbose=None,
        quiet=None,
        superquiet=None,
        errors=None,
        capture_output=True,
        capture_stderr=None,
    ):
        """
        If session is provided and has an env attribute, it is used to execute tools.
        If env is provided, it is used to execute tools. If both session and env are
        provided, env is used to execute tools and session is ignored.
        However, session and env interaction may change in the future.

        If overwrite is provided, a an overwrite is set for all the tools.
        When overwrite is set to False, individual tool calls can set overwrite
        to True. If overwrite is set in the session or env, it is used.
        Note that once overwrite is set to True globally, an individual tool call
        cannot set it back to False.

        If verbose, quiet, superquiet is set to True, the corresponding verbosity level
        is set for all the tools. If one of them is set to False and the environment
        has the corresponding variable set, it is unset.
        The values cannot be combined. If multiple ones are set to True, the most
        verbose one wins.

        In case a tool run fails, indicating that by non-zero return code,
        *grass.exceptions.CalledModuleError* exception is raised by default. This can
        be changed by passing, e.g., `errors="ignore"`. The *errors* parameter
        is passed to the *grass.script.handle_errors* function which determines
        the specific behavior.

        Text outputs from the tool are captured by default, both standard output
        (stdout) and standard error output (stderr). Both will be part of the result
        object returned by each tool run. Additionally, the standard error output will
        be included in the exception message. When *capture_output* is set to False,
        outputs are not captured in Python as values and go where the Python process
        outputs go (this is usually clear in command line, but less clear in a Jupyter
        notebook). When *capture_stderr* is set to True, the standard error output
        is captured and included in the exception message even if *capture_outputs*
        is set to False.

        If *env* or other *Popen* arguments are provided to one of the tool running
        functions, the constructor parameters except *errors* are ignored.
