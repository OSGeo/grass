    change when the tile's rescaling parameters are precomputed by
    OpenStreetMap.rescale(). One of the rescaling parameters is the delta zoom
    level dz which indicates how many zoom levels the tile should be rescaled
    from its original zoom level z. OpenStreetMap.draw_rescaled() actually
    rescales the tile and stores its image in the rescaled_image attribute.
    Only key and z never change once they are set. Initially, dz is set to 0

        Instantiate a new instance of the OpenStreetMap class.

        Args:
            create_image (function): Function(width, height) for creating a
                new image for the entire map. This function should take the
                width and height of the image. Since GetOSM is an OpenStreetMap
                downloader and drawing helper, it does not draw anything by
                itself. Instead, it takes drawing functions that are specific
                to a GUI framework as callback functions, and calls them. In
                this way, tile downloading can take place in a separate thread
                from the main GUI thread, and GetOSM does not have to worry
                about how to draw the map.
            draw_image (function): Function(image) for actually drawing the
                created map image onto the canvas. It should take the output
                image returned by the create_image() function.
            create_tile (function): Function(data) for creating a tile image
                using raw data stored in self.cached_tiles[].image with its raw
                flag set to True (see the CachedTile clsas). It should take the
                data argument that is raw from the OpenStreetMap server.
            draw_tile (function): Function(image, tile, x, y) for patching a
                tile on the image at x and y. This function should not crop the
                tile image and should only place it at the given location. It
                should take the image from create_image(), a tile from
                create_tile(), and the x and y of the tile (see the Tile
                class).
            resample_tile (function): Function(tile, dz) for rescaling a tile
                image by resampling its pixel values. It should scale up (zoom
                in) or down (zoom out) if dz is posiive or negative,
                respectively. The dz argument is always an int which can be
                converted to a float scaling factor of 2**dz. This funciton
                should take a tile from create_tile() stored in
                self.cached_tiles[].image with the raw flag set to False (see
                the CachedTile class) and a delta zoom level dz (see the Tile

            width (int): Canvas width in pixels. Defaults to 256.
            height (int): Canvas height in pixels. Defaults to 256.
            lat (float): Center latitude in decimal degrees. Defaults to 0.
