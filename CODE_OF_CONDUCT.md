# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member in our community and
want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable experience.
Accordingly, those who participate in the GRASS project are expected
to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

GRASS uses the [NumFOCUS Code of Conduct (CoC)](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct).

## The Short Version

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally.
Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes
are not appropriate.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language
and imagery is not appropriate.

GRASS and NumFOCUS are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
