name: Verify Success reusable workflow

# Use this reusable workflow as a job of workflow to check that
# all jobs, including ones ran through a matrix, were successful.
# This job can then be used as a required status check in the
# repo's rulesets, that allows to change the required jobs or
# the matrix values of a required job without needing to change
# the rulesets settings. In the future, GitHub might have a
# solution to this natively.

# This reusable workflow has inputs to change what is required
# to have this workflow pass. It handles the cases were there were
# skipped jobs, and no successful jobs.

# The jobs to check must set as the `needs` for the job calling this
# reusable workflow. This also means that the job ids should be in the
# same workflow file. The calling job must be set to always run to be
# triggered when jobs are skipped or cancelled.
# Then, set the `needs_context` input like:
# `needs_context: ${{ toJson(needs) }}`

# Example usage, as a job inside a workflow:
# ```
# jobs:
#   a-job-id:
#     ...
#   another-job-id:
#     ...
#   some-job-success:
#     name: Some Job Result
#     needs:
#       - a-job-id
#       - another-job-id
#     if: ${{ always() }}
#     uses: ./.github/workflows/verify-success.yml
#     with:
#       needs_context: ${{ toJson(needs) }}
# ```
