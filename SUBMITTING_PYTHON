NOTE: Please improve this list!

Dear (new) GRASS Developer,

When submitting Python code to GRASS SVN repository, please take
care of following rules:

[ see SUBMITTING for C hints ]
[ see SUBMITTING_SCRIPTS for shell script hints ]
[ see SUBMITTING_TCLTK for tcl and tk hints ]
[ see SUBMITTING_DOCS for documentation ]


1.  Indentation

    As Python determines nesting based upon indentation, it
    isn't just a stylistic issue.

    Please use 4-space indentation (GNU Emacs python-mode default).

    See also "Python Style Guide" by Guido van Rossum
    http://www.python.org/doc/essays/styleguide.html


2.  Add a header section to the script you submit and make sure you
    include the copyright. The purpose section is meant to contain a
    general over view of the code in the file to assist other
    programmers that will need to make changes to your code. For this
    purpose use Python Docstring, see
    http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/docstrings.html

    Example (fictitious header for a script called r.myscript):

"""
MODULE:    r.myscript

AUTHOR(S): Me <email AT some domain>

PURPOSE:   Calculates univariate statistics from a GRASS raster map

           for details.
"""

   The copyright protects your rights according to GNU General Public
   License (www.gnu.org).


3.  - deleted.
    We don't want the $ ID $ in source code any more as it causes problems
    for the branches.


4. PLEASE take the time to add comments throughout your code explaining what
    the code is doing. It will save a HUGE amount of time and frustration for
    other programmers that may have to change your code in the future.


5. Make sure a new line is at the end of each file.


6. For consistency, use README rather than README.txt for any README files.


7. Be sure to develop on top of the LATEST GRASS code (which is in SVN repository).
   You can re-check before submission with 'svn diff':

   Be sure to create unified ("diff -u") format. "Plain" diffs (the default
   format) are risky, because they will apply without warning to code which
   has been substantially changed; they are also harder to read than unified.

   Such diffs should be made from the top-level directory, e.g.
   "svn diff gui/wxpython/wxgui.py"; that way, the diff will
   include the pathname rather than just "wxgui.py".


8. When submitting new files to the repository set SVN properties,
   usually for directory

      svn:ignore : *.pyc

   or e.g. for Python file
    
      svn:mime-type : text/python
      svn:keywords : Author Date Id
      svn:eol-style : native

   See
   http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.advanced.props.html


8. Tell the other developers about the new code using the following e-mail:
   grass-dev@lists.osgeo.org
 
   To subscribe to this mailing list, see
   http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-dev


9. In case of questions feel free to contact the developers at the above
   mailing list.
