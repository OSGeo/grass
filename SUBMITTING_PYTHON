NOTE: Please improve this list!

Dear (new) GRASS developer,

when submitting Python code to GRASS SVN repository, please take
care of following rules:

[ see SUBMITTING for C hints ]
[ see SUBMITTING_WXGUI for wxPython GUI code hints ]
[ see SUBMITTING_DOCS for documentation ]

See also http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

0.  Indentation

    As Python determines nesting based upon indentation, it isn't just
    a stylistic issue.

    Please use 4-space indentation (GNU Emacs python-mode default).

    See also "Python Style Guide" by Guido van Rossum
    http://www.python.org/doc/essays/styleguide.html


1.  Instructions for the GRASS script parser can be found in the g.parser 
    module's help page.
    http://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/html70_user/g.parser.html


2.  Use the directory structure to place your script appropriately into
    the source tree
    	- scripts go into scripts/

    Also add a Makefile and a <module>.html file into this directory.
    See existing Python scripts for examples.


3.  Add a header section to the script you submit and make sure you
    include the copyright. The purpose section is meant to contain a
    general over view of the code in the file to assist other
    programmers that will need to make changes to your code. For this
    purpose use Python Docstring, see
    http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/docstrings.html

    Example (fictitious header for a script called g.myscript):

"""
MODULE:    g.myscript

AUTHOR(S): John Doe <email AT some domain>

PURPOSE:   Describe your script here...

COPYRIGHT: (C) 2007 John Doe, and by the GRASS Development Team

           This program is free software under the GNU General Public
           License (>=v2). Read the file COPYING that comes with GRASS
           for details.
"""

    The copyright protects your rights according to GNU General Public
    License (www.gnu.org).

    You can easily autogenerate the header and parameters from an existing
    module using the --script flag. Example:

     d.rast --script

    Just select an existing module which is close to your application to save
    efforts.


4.  We don't want the $ ID $ in source code any more as it causes problems
    for the branches.


5.  Create and use secure temporary files and directories. Use the
    grass.tempfile() or grass.tempdir() functions to do this. e.g.

	# setup temporary file
	TMP = grass.tempfile()
	if TMP is None:
	    grass.fatal("Unable to create temporary files")
	    

6.  Use grass.findfile() when there is a need to test if a map exists.

	# test for input raster map
	result = grass.find_file(name = map_name, element = 'cell', quiet = True)
	if not result['file']
	  grass.fatal("Raster map <%s> not found" % map_name)

	# test for input vector map
	result = grass.find_file(name = map_name, element = 'vector', quiet = True)
	if not result['file']
	  grass.fatal("Vector map <%s> not found" % map_name)

     ... and so forth. See 'g.manual g.findfile' for details.

7.  For any informational output, use the grass.message()
    function. For error messages should be used grass.fatal_error() or
    grass.error() and for warnings grass.warning(). For debugging
    purposes grass.debug().

	#normal message:
	grass.message("Done")

	# warning:
        grass.warning("No input values found, using default values")

	# error:
        grass.error("No map found")

	# fatal error:
	grass.fatal_error("No map found, exiting")

	# debug output (use g.gisenv to enable/disable)
        grass.debug("Our calculated value is: %d" % value)

    Try to omit any usage of the 'print' command for informational output.


8.  PLEASE take the time to add comments throughout your code explaining what
    the code is doing. It will save a HUGE amount of time and frustration for
    other programmers that may have to change your code in the future.


9.  Make sure a new line is at the end of each file.


10. For consistency, use README rather than README.txt for any README files.


11. Be sure to develop on top of the LATEST GRASS code (which is in SVN repository).
    You can re-check before submission with 'svn diff':

    Be sure to create unified ("diff -u") format. "Plain" diffs (the default
    format) are risky, because they will apply without warning to code which
    has been substantially changed; they are also harder to read than unified.

    Such diffs should be made from the top-level directory, e.g.
    "svn diff gui/wxpython/wxgui.py"; that way, the diff will
    include the pathname rather than just "wxgui.py".


12. When submitting new files to the repository set SVN properties,
    usually for directory

      svn:ignore : *.pyc

    or e.g. for Python file

      svn:mime-type : text/python
      svn:keywords : Author Date Id
      svn:eol-style : native

      svn propset svn:mime-type text/python new/file.py
      svn propset svn:keywords "Author Date Id" new/file.py
      svn propset svn:eol-style native new/file.py

    See
    http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.advanced.props.html


13. Tell the other developers about the new code using the following e-mail:
    grass-dev@lists.osgeo.org
 
    To subscribe to this mailing list, see
    http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-dev


14. In case of questions feel free to contact the developers at the above
    mailing list.
