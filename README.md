## Description

[GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/), Geographic Resources Analysis Support System,
is a powerful computational engine for raster, vector, and geospatial processing.
It supports terrain and ecosystem modeling, hydrology, data management,
and imagery processing. With a built-in temporal framework and Python API,
it enables advanced time series analysis and rapid geospatial programming,
optimized for large-scale analysis on various hardware configurations.

You can use GRASS as your desktop Geographic Information System (GIS)
or as a geoprocessing engine through command-line, Python or R interface.

GRASS is open-source and free software, available under the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/#GPL),
and hosted by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation ([OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/)).
