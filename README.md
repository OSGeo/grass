GRASS GIS Repository
====================

GRASS GIS ([https://grass.osgeo.org/](https://grass.osgeo.org/)) is a Geographic Information System
used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics/map production,
spatial modeling, and visualization.


How to get write access here?
-----------------------------

In general: you don't really need write access as you can simply open a
[pull request](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/pulls) to contribute to GRASS GIS.

Want to become a core developer? See
[Procedure for gaining Git write access](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/HowToContribute#WriteaccesstotheGRASScorerepository)

How to compile GRASS?
---------------------

> See INSTALL file.

Yes, you should really read INSTALL.

How to generate the 'Programmer's Manual'?
------------------------------------------

This needs doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org) and optionally
Graphviz dot (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/).

To build the GRASS programmer's documentation, run
```
make htmldocs
```
or to generate documentation as single html file (recommended for simple reading)
```
make htmldocs-single
```
here. This takes quite some time. The result is in `lib/html/index.html`
which refers to further document repositories in
```
   lib/vector/html/index.html
   lib/db/html/index.html
   lib/gis/html/index.html
```

The master file is: `./grasslib.dox` where all sub-documents have to
be linked into.

To generate the documents in PDF format, run

```
make pdfdocs
```

An online version is available [here](https://grass.osgeo.org/programming7/)

## Docker

Build using the downloaded source code (in the directory with the
source code):

```
    docker build -t grassgis77 .
```

A test run (assuming you have existing GRASS GIS location; it can be downloaded from
[here](https://grass.osgeo.org/sampledata/north_carolina/nc_basic_spm_grass7.zip))

```
# case 1: launching in the grassdata directory in which the location is stored:
docker run -it --rm --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) --volume $(pwd):/data --env HOME=/data/ grassgis77 \
    grass --text nc_spm_08_grass7/user1 --exec g.region -p

# case 2: launching anywhere
docker run -it --rm --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) --volume /your/test/grassdata/:/data --env HOME=/data/ grassgis77 \
    grass /data/nc_basic_spm/PERMANENT --exec g.region -p
```

Note that the first `grassgis77` is the name of the image while the second
`grass` is the name of the executable.

To run the tests (again assuming local location):

```
    docker run -it --rm --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) --volume /your/test/grassdata/:/data --env HOME=/data/ -w /code/grass \
        grassgis77 grass /data/nc_basic_spm/PERMANENT --exec \
            python -m grass.gunittest.main \
                --location nc_basic_spm --location-type nc
```

Note: If you compiled locally before building the Docker image, you may
encounter problems as the local configuration and locally compiled file
are copied to and used in the Docker image. To make sure you don't have
this issue, clean all the compiled files from the source code:

```
make distclean
```
