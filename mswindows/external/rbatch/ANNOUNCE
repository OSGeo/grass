A new version of the Windows batchfiles is available.  

CHANGES

The key change is the new R.bat utility.  R.bat has a new interface and 
extended functionality covering many of the other prior utilities.  (These
older utilities are no longer needed and have been removed.)

Unlike R.bat which requires no configuration the new Rpathset.bat utility is
configured by manually changing the Windows batch SET statements in it.  The
main advantage is just that it is very simple internally which may be 
advantageous in some situations involving customization.

A new pdf document accompanies the utilities providing more detail.

OVERVIEW

These are self contained independent no-install Windows batch, javascript and 
.hta files. Just place any that you wish to use on your Windows PATH.

R.bat

R.bat allows one to run R without setting any environment variables, registry
keys or any modification of the Windows path.  Just download this utility,
place it in your Windows path and then to launch Rgui.exe from the Windows cmd
line do this:

   R gui

R.bat locates R, MiKTeX and Rtools using the registry or heuristics and then
runs the subcommand indicated by the first argument.  

In addition to the gui subcommand, the following subcommands are available: cd,
cmd, dir, gui, help, ls, path, R, script, show, SetReg, tools, touch.

Some examples are:

R -- run R.exe
R gui -- run Rgui.exe
R CMD build mypkg -- run Rcmd.exe build mypkg
R script myScript.R -- run Rscript.exe myScript.R

R dir -- list directories in R_ROOT, typically those in C:\Program Files\R
R ls -- same
R help -- help info
R show -- show R_ variable values used (R_ROOT, R_HOME, R_VER, R_ARCH, etc.)

R path -- temporarily add R, MiKTeX and Rtools to the Windows path
R tools -- similar but only add MiKTeX and Rtools to the Windows path

Except for R touch (which updates the date on your R_HOME directory) and 
R SetReg (which calls RSetReg.exe to update the registry with your R version),
R.bat makes no permanent changes to your system.

Rpathset.bat

Rpathset.bat temporarily sets the Windows path to R, Rtools and MiKTeX
based on SET statements that the user can configure manually.  It is an
alternative to R.bat that lacks R.bat's "no configuration" nature but may be 
preferred in some situations due to its internal simplicity.

Also Rpathset.bat is more likely to work on systems that have not been 
tested given its simplicity.  (The utilities were tested on 32 bit Windows 
Vista and 64 bit Windows 8 systems.)

Other

Other commands which continue to be available are copydir.bat, movedir.bat, 
el.js, clip2r.js and find-miktex.hta .  These copy and move R libraries,
run a command in elevated mode (i.e. as Administrator), copy the clipboard to
a running R instance and find MiKTeX.
