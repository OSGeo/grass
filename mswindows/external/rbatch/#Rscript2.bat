:: INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
:: Modify the definitions of R_HOME and R_ARCH as needed
:: (To get the value of R_HOME go into R and issue this command: 
::        normalizePath(R.home())
:: and use its output as the value here.  If you upgrade R to another
:: version R_HOME will need to be changed. For most users R_ARCH can 
:: be left as set but if you have a 32 bit system then comment out the
:: line setting R_ARCH and uncomment the prior line.)
::
:: RUN INSTRUCTIONS:
:: Create an R script whose first line is:
::  #Rscript2.bat %0 %*
:: and give it a .bat extension.  If it is called test.bat then call it 
:: like this (adding arguments if any):
::  test.bat 

set R_HOME=C:\Program Files\R\R-3.0.2

:: 32 or 64 bit version of R.
