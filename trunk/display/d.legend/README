this is d.legend (formerly d.leg.thin).

Once upon a time there were d.legend *and* d.leg.thin (a try for a better
implementation of d.legend). Then I merged both, in fact I merged a few good
pieces of d.legend into d.leg.thin and renamed it in Gmakefile to d.legend
(to avoid user's confusion as a d.leg.thin without d.legend didn't make
sense).
That's why d.legend continued to live in src/display/d.leg.thin (but
in the Gmakefile it is called d.legend).

Yes, a bit confusing. But today only the directory name is confusing.

Hope this clarifies it. In 5.1 we should store it into
display/d.legend
