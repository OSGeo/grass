sqlp is SQL parser library

sqp is intended as library for simple dbmi drivers (like dbf, txt).
yac.y and lex.l was originally stolen from unixODBC 3/2001 and modified.

An input may be subset of SQL statements. Currently supported:
SELECT FROM WHERE
INSERT INTO
UPDATE WHERE
DELETE FROM WHERE
CREATE TABLE
DROP TABLE
[...]

New types have to be added in yac.y, lex.l, print.c and
../../../include/sqlp.h .
In ./test/ is a test program to the the SQL parser (see
README there).
