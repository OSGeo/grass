The very beginning of a swig interface for Grass.

This is mainly Perl. Swig supports many languages, thus generic Swig
things should be separated and only Swig/Perl things left here.

Compiling this is done the usual perl way:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

you won't need this for a very long time:
make install

What I've done:

1) the skeleton was created using h2xs

2) hand-edited grass.i and typemaps.i

3) copied gisdefs.h here and commented out some things

   created grass_wrap.c and Grass.pm with
   swig -perl -shadow grass.i

It might be a good idea to create a thin header layer between the
actual Grass and Swig.

4) copied one Grass program r_slope_aspect.c here and made it into
a function

This procedure could perhaps be automated somehow.

5) Edited Makefile.PL for some configurations. Please edit them
according to your config.

Please extend and enjoy :)
