<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<i>ximgview</i> is a simple X11 image viewer for 32-bpp BMP images, as
can be created with the <em><a href="pngdriver.html">PNG</a></em> and
<em><a href="cairodriver.html">cairo</a></em> drivers. The display is
continually refreshed.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The display driver must be configure to map the file, with
<em>GRASS_PNG_MAPPED=TRUE</em>. This ensures that the file will remain
a constant size, rather than being truncated whenever it is updated.
