<h2>Bugs / Todo</h2>
<p>Updated January 8, 2004</p>

<pre>
1. Missing/not working which worked in SGI version
-------------------------------------------------

Scripting
2/2002 Scripting for dynamic surfaces needs more testing, 
but it seems to be working in principle.

Mask
12/2003 masked area is black instead of background color (now white) - bug?
  one needs to do DRAW twice for mask to take effect or its removal
  to take effect. Invert mask leads to "mask not set"
  when I put the same map as transparency - it worked as mask
  transparency does not have remove button, but setting a new constant to 0 works

Loading sites
12/2003 this needs to be tested
After hitting the maximum site files loaded, it correctly displays
an error but then hangs-on with "please wait" (probably trying
to load them - it should return back where it was
and not attempt to load)

Occasionally, mouse over slider is interpreted as a movement of slider causing
the fully rendered image going to the grid style mode
12/2003 I haven't observed it happening on with the current version yet

2. Things which were in SG3d but were never ported to nviz
----------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Legends, labels, including labels for sites
12/2003 included, but still needs some work

2.2 Scale, north
12/2003 included, still needs some work, x,y,z axes with tics would be useful for
creating images for publications

2.3 More options for display of sites based on their attributes
12/2003 work started but not there yet

2.4 Display of lat/long data on a sphere (globe) or its part

3. Experimental capabilities for combining volumes and surfaces in sg4d
----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Integration of r3.showdspf with surface visualization
12/2003 ongoing development

4. Capabilities of nviz added to some older versions but not included in the release
---------------------------------------------------
4.1 Draw a flow line from a queried point

Testing interactive placement of flowlines...
position.c:#ifdef DO_TEST
panel_query.tcl:# DO_TEST
/GRASS.src/4.2/grp.contrib/oglnviz/scripts

5. Updated stuff from BUGS_TODO and new bugs/fixes needed
-----------------------------------------------------
12/2003 cutting planes give transparent crossection instead of greay for GR option
there are some more inconsistencies - it needs to be tested more.

12/2003 - the follwoing needs to be tested
  - The second issue is with the error you report above when entering a
    vertical exag. manually.  The error that you are getting is a TCL error.
    To try and get a decent vertical exaggeration you should try manually
    setting is as you were doing above above. Because you are dealing with
    such small numbers you may have to enter the value a couple of times
    before it is accepted. The reason for this is that TCL want to use a
    value that is a multiple of the scale-bar resolution.  The resolution
    should be reset to match the value you have entered -- it is this
    calculation that is generating the error (I think) that you describe
    above.

12/2003 - is this still true
  - nviz does not work well with latitude-longitude projections because it
    uses decimal degrees instead of metres for the resolution. Thus is why
    the vertical exaggeration is such a small number.

  - Z axis scalable when displaying 3D sites
    (Being worked on by ?)

  - eventually color problem in lat/long locations
    (Being worked on by ?)

12/2003 - see m.nviz.script (nee d.nviz) - should be mentioned in tutorial
  - high resolution output (definable extent like CELL driver)
    (Being worked on by
     probably Bob Covill <bcovill@tekmap.ns.ca>)

?? Check out Nv_force_panel in nviz.in

6. Notes for interface - if changes are made tutorial needs to be updated too
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 Surface Panel
should we replace Surface style -> Draw style or Surface draw style
                  Grid style -> Interactive style

6.2 Surface - Position pannel
this is probably more complicated, but to make moving the surface around more natural
the cross in the positioning square should be aligned with the current view -
Follow viewpoint option?
Currently, depending from where you are looking at the surface, you need to move the cross
to the left if you want to move the surface to the right, same for north and south
Or, a simpler solution would be just put there N S E W as we have in lights
into the square

7. Wish list for future

7.1 Various types of lines (besides the line width and color), line labels
