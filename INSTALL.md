## PREREQUISITES

The install order matters. GRASS needs at least two libraries
which have to be installed before installing/compiling GRASS:
For links to the software, see [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) in this
directory.

Installation order:

1. PROJ
2. GDAL-OGR (compiled without GRASS support)
3. optionally: databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, sqlite
4. GRASS GIS
5. optionally: GDAL-OGR-GRASS plugin

## (A) SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTION

GRASS source code is currently distributed in 2 forms:

### Officially released source code

The full source code version contains all the GRASS source code
required for compilation. It is distributed as one file (*.tar.gz
package) and the version is composed of 3 numbers, e.g. 3.7.0, 3.7.1
etc. See
<https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/releases>.

### Snapshots of source code (generated from GitHub)

This version of the source code can be acquired either from the GitHub
repository (<https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/>) or as a auto-generated snapshot
(`*.tar.gz` package) of the GitHub repository. The snapshot name
contains the date when the snapshot was created (checked out from
the GitHub repository), e.g. grass-3.7.git_src_snapshot_2022_04_27.tar.gz
from <https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-devel/source/snapshot/>

## (B) COMPILATION

IMPORTANT: All Unix based distributions are different.
For Solaris, see hints below.

The command,

```bash
./configure --help
```

explains the options used to disable the compilation of non-mandatory
GRASS modules. See [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) for details on dependencies.
Detailed Wiki notes for various operating systems (MS-Windows, GNU/Linux
distributions, FreeBSD, AIX, etc) are available at:
<https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Compile_and_Install>

First step of the compilation (-g for debugging, or -O2 for optimization):

```bash
CFLAGS="-g -Wall" ./configure
```

Explanation of make targets:

```text
make install       - installs the binary

make bindist       - make a binary package with install script

make srcdist       - make a source package for distribution
make srclibsdist   - make a source package for library distribution

make libs          - make libraries only

make clean         - delete all files created by 'make'
make distclean     - 'make clean' + delete all files created by './configure'
make libsclean     - clean libraries compiled by 'make libs'

make htmldocs      - generate programmer's documentation as HTML files
make packagehtmldocs - package programmer's documentation in HTML
make pdfdocs       - generate programmer's documentation as PDF files
```

Next step is the compilation itself:

```bash
make
```

Note for Solaris users (see also Wiki page above):

To configure GRASS correctly on a system which doesn't have a suitable
install program (AC_PROG_INSTALL ignores versions which are known to
have problems), you need to ensure that $srcdir is an absolute path,
by using e.g.:

```bash
`pwd`/configure ...
```

or:

```bash
./configure --srcdir=`pwd` ...
```

Then proceed as described above.

Note when using a compiler different from "gcc":

By setting environment variables, the compiler
names can be defined (C and C++):

```bash
CC=cc CPP=cpp ./configure ...
```

## (C) COMPILATION NOTES for 64bit platforms

To successfully compile GRASS on 64bit platforms, the required
FFTW2 library has to be compiled with -fPIC flag:

```bash
#this applies to FFTW3, not to GRASS GIS:
cd fftw-3.3.4/
CFLAGS="-fPIC" ./configure
make
make install
```

## (D) INSTALLATION (first time)

After compilation, the resulting code is stored in the directory

```bash
./dist.$ARCH
```

and the scripts (grass, ...) in

```bash
./bin.$ARCH
```

To run GRASS, simply start

```bash
./bin.$ARCH/grass
```

or run

```bash
make install
grass
```

## (E) INSTALLATION ON MACOSX

See the ReadMe.rtf in the ./macosx/ folder and the Wiki page above.

## (F) RUNNING GRASS GIS

Download a sample data package from the GRASS web site, see
<https://grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data/>

Extract the data set and point the "Database" field in the
GRASS GIS startup menu to the extracted directory.

Enjoy.

## (G) UPDATE OF SOURCE CODE

Assuming that you want to update your current installation from
GitHub, you have to perform a few steps. In general:

- update from GitHub
- configure, compile

In detail:

```bash
cd /where/your/grass-source-code/lives/
git fetch --all
git merge upstream/main
./configure ...
make
make install
```

For details, see <https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/HowToGit>

## (H) COMPILING INDIVIDUAL MODULES - OWN MODULES

To compile (self-made) GRASS modules or to compile modified modules
at least the GRASS libraries have to be compiled locally. This is
done by launching:

```bash
make libs
```

Then change into the module's directory and launch the "make"
command. The installation can be either done with "make install" from
the main source code directory or locally with

```bash
"INST_NOW=y make"
```

You may want to define an alias for this:

```bash
alias gmake='INST_NOW=y make'
```

Then simply compile/install the current module with

```bash
gmake
```

Note: If you keep your module source code outside the standard GRASS
source code directory structure, you will have to change the relative
path(s) in the Makefile to absolute path(s).

## (I) CODE OPTIMIZATION

If you would like to set compiler optimisations, for a possibly faster
binary, type (don't enter a ";" anywhere):

```bash
CFLAGS=-O ./configure
```

or,

```bash
setenv CFLAGS -O
./configure
```

whichever works on your shell. Use -O2 instead of -O if your compiler
supports this (note: O is the letter, not zero). Using the "gcc" compiler,
you can also specify processor specific flags (examples, please suggest
better settings to us):

```bash
CFLAGS="-mcpu=athlon -O2" # AMD Athlon processor with code optimisations
CFLAGS="-mcpu=pentium" # Intel Pentium processor
CFLAGS="-mcpu=pentium4" # Intel Pentium4 processor
CFLAGS="-O2 -msse -msse2 -mfpmath=sse \
        -minline-all-stringops" # Intel XEON 64bit processor
CFLAGS="-mtune=nocona -m64 -minline-all-stringops" # Intel Pentium 64bit processor
```

Note: As of version 4.3.0, GCC offers the -march=native switch that
enables CPU auto-detection and automatically selects optimizations supported
by the local machine at GCC runtime including -mtune.

To find out optional CFLAGS for your platform, enter:

```bash
gcc -dumpspecs
```

See also: <https://gcc.gnu.org/>

A real fast GRASS version (and small binaries) will be created with
LDFLAGS set to "stripping" (but this disables debugging):

```bash
CFLAGS="-O2 -mcpu=<cpu_see_above> -Wall" LDFLAGS="-s" ./configure
```

## (J) DEBUGGING OPTIONS

The `LDFLAGS=""` part must be undefined as `-s` will strip the debugging
information.

Don't use `-O` for CFLAGS if you want to be able to step through function
bodies. When optimisation is enabled, the compiler will re-order statements
and re-arrange expressions, resulting in object code which barely resembles
the source code.

The `-g` and `-Wall` compiler flags are often useful for assisting debugging:

```bash
CFLAGS="-g -Wall" ./configure
```

See also the file ./doc/debugging.txt and the Wiki page
<https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_Debugging>

## (K) SUPPORT

Note that this code is still actively being developed and errors inevitably
turn up. If you find a bug, please report it to the GRASS bug tracking system
so we can fix it. See <https://grass.osgeo.org/contribute/>
