## Addons

In addition to the core tools, GRASS also provides a number of addons that
extend the functionality of GRASS. Addons are part of the [OSGeo/grass-addons](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons)
repository and are a great place to plubish and share custom tools, models, and reserach.
The addons are maintained by the GRASS community and are a great way to extend the
functionality of GRASS.
