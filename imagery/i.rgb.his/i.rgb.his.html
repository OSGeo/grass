<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.rgb.his</em> is an image processing program that
processes three input raster map layers as red, green, and
blue components and produces three output raster map layers
representing the hue, intensity, and saturation of the
data.  The output raster map layers are created by a
standard red-green-blue (RGB) to hue-intensity-saturation
(HIS) color transformation.  Each output raster map layer
is given a linear gray scale color table.  The current
geographic region definition and mask settings are
respected.
