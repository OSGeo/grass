## DESCRIPTION

*i.rgb.his* is an image processing program that processes three input
raster map layers as red, green, and blue components and produces three
output raster map layers representing the hue, intensity, and saturation
of the data. The output raster map layers are created by a standard
red-green-blue (RGB) to hue-intensity-saturation (HIS) color
transformation. Each output raster map layer is given a linear gray
scale color table. The current geographic region definition and mask
settings are respected.
