## DESCRIPTION

*i.gensig* is a non-interactive method for generating input into
*[i.maxlik](i.maxlik.md)*. It can be used as the first pass in the GRASS
two-pass classification process (instead of *[i.cluster](i.cluster.md)*
or *[g.gui.iclass](g.gui.iclass.md))*. It reads a raster map layer,
called the training map, which has some of the pixels or regions already
classified. *i.gensig* will then extract spectral signatures from an
image based on the classification of the pixels in the training map and
make these signatures available to *[i.maxlik](i.maxlik.md)*.

The user would then execute the GRASS program *[i.maxlik](i.maxlik.md)*
to actually create the final classified map.

This module generates signature files of type "sig". Use module
[i.signatures](i.signatures.md) to manage generated signature files.

All raster maps used to generate signature file can have semantic label
set. Use *[r.support](r.support.md)* to set semantic labels of each
member of the imagery group. Signatures generated for one scene are
suitable for classification of other scenes as long as they consist of
same raster bands (semantic labels match).

Input **trainingmap** map must be prepared by the user in advance using vector or raster
digitizer. Of course other methods could be devised by the user for
creating this training map - *i.gensig* makes no assumption about the
origin of this map layer. It simply creates signatures for the classes
defined in the training map for the image to be classified (the image is
specified in other options - see below). The *[wxGUI vector
digitizer](wxGUI.vdigit.md)* can be used for interactively creating the
training map.

Input **group** is the name of the group that contains the band files which
comprise the image to be analyzed. The *[i.group](i.group.md)* command
is used to construct groups of raster layers which comprise an image.

Input **subgroup** names the subgroup within the group that selects a subset of the
bands to be analyzed. The *[i.group](i.group.md)* command is also used
to prepare this subgroup. The subgroup mechanism allows the user to
select a subset of all the band files that form an image.

Input **signaturefile** is the resultant signature file (containing the means and
covariance matrices) for each class in the training map that is
associated with the band files in the subgroup select. Resultant singature file can be used with any other
imagery group as long as semantic labels match.

## NOTES

The structure of the SIG files generated by *i.gensig* is as follows
(ASCII file, used internally by *i.maxlik*):  
*Note: the line numbers are not present in the file but have been added
here for explanation only*:

SIG file "lsat7_2000_gensig":
