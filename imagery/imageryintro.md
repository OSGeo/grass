### Image processing in general

GRASS GIS provides a powerful suite of tools for the processing and
analysis of geospatial raster data, including satellite imagery and
aerial photography. Its image processing capabilities encompass a broad
range of preprocessing operations, such as data import, georeferencing,
radiometric calibration, and atmospheric correction. It is particularly
suited for handling Earth observation data, enabling the analysis of
multispectral and temporal datasets. GRASS GIS supports advanced
functionalities such as image classification, sensor fusion, and point
cloud statistics. The calculation of vegetation indices further enables
analyses of environmental, agricultural, and land cover dynamics. An
extensive collection of
[addons](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass8/manuals/addons/#i) further
enhances its image processing capabilities, particularly in the context
of Earth observation and remote sensing applications. **Digital numbers
and physical values (reflection/radiance-at-sensor):**

Satellite imagery is commonly stored in Digital Numbers (DN) for
minimizing the storage volume, i.e. the originally sampled analog
physical value (color, temperature, etc) is stored a discrete
representation in 8-16 bits. For example, Landsat data are stored in
8bit values (i.e., ranging from 0 to 255); other satellite data may be
stored in 10 or 16 bits. Having data stored in DN, it implies that these
data are not yet the observed ground reality. Such data are called
"at-satellite", for example the amount of energy sensed by the sensor of
the satellite platform is encoded in 8 or more bits. This energy is
called radiance-at-sensor. To obtain physical values from DNs, satellite
image providers use a linear transform equation `(y = a * x + b)` to
encode the radiance-at-sensor in 8 to 16 bits. DNs can be turned back
into physical values by applying the reverse formula
`(x = (y - b) / a)`.

The GRASS GIS module [i.landsat.toar](i.landsat.toar.md) easily
transforms Landsat DN to radiance-at-sensor (top of atmosphere, TOA).
The equivalent module for ASTER data is [i.aster.toar](i.aster.toar.md).
For other satellites, [r.mapcalc](r.mapcalc.md) can be employed.

**Reflection/radiance-at-sensor and surface reflectance**

When radiance-at-sensor has been obtained, still the atmosphere
influences the signal as recorded at the sensor. This atmospheric
interaction with the sun energy reflected back into space by
ground/vegetation/soil needs to be corrected. The need of removing
atmospheric artifacts stems from the fact that the atmospheric
conditions are changing over time. Hence, to gain comparability between
Earth surface images taken at different times, atmospheric need to be
removed converting at-sensor values which are top of atmosphere to
surface reflectance values.

In GRASS GIS, there are two ways to apply atmospheric correction for
satellite imagery. A simple, less accurate way for Landsat is with
[i.landsat.toar](i.landsat.toar.md), using the DOS correction method.
The more accurate way is using [i.atcorr](i.atcorr.md) (which supports
many satellite sensors). The atmospherically corrected sensor data
represent surface
[reflectance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reflectance), which ranges
theoretically from 0% to 100%. Note that this level of data correction
is the proper level of correction to calculate vegetation indices.

In GRASS GIS, image data are identical to [raster data](rasterintro.md).
However, a couple of commands are explicitly dedicated to image
processing. The geographic boundaries of the raster/imagery file are
described by the north, south, east, and west fields. These values
describe the lines which bound the map at its edges. These lines do NOT
pass through the center of the grid cells at the edge of the map, but
along the edge of the map itself.

As a general rule in GRASS:

1. Raster/imagery output maps have their bounds and resolution equal to
    those of the current region.
2. Raster/imagery input maps are automatically cropped/padded and
    rescaled (using nearest-neighbor resampling) to match the current
    region.

### Imagery import

The module [r.in.gdal](r.in.gdal.md) offers a common interface for many
different raster and satellite image formats. Additionally, it also
offers options such as on-the-fly project creation or extension of the
default region to match the extent of the imported raster map. For
special cases, other import modules are available. Always the full map
is imported. Imagery data can be group (e.g. channel-wise) with
[i.group](i.group.md).

For importing scanned maps, the user will need to create a x,y-project,
scan the map in the desired resolution and save it into an appropriate
raster format (e.g. tiff, jpeg, png, pbm) and then use
[r.in.gdal](r.in.gdal.md) to import it. Based on reference points the
scanned map can be rectified to obtain geocoded data.

### Semantic label information

Semantic labels are a description which can be stored as metadata. To
print available semantic labels relevant for multispectral satellite
data, use [i.band.library](i.band.library.md).
[r.semantic.label](r.semantic.label.md) allows assigning of these
satellite imagery band references as defined in
[i.band.library](i.band.library.md). Semantic labels are also used in
signature files of imagery classification tools. Therefore, signature
files of one imagery or raster group can be used to classify a different
group with identical semantic labels.

*New enhanced classification workflow involving semantic labels.*

With [r.support](r.support.md) any sort of semantic label the user
wishes may be added (i.e., not only those registered in
*i.band.library*). Semantic labels are supported also by the
[temporal](temporalintro.md) GRASS modules.

### Image processing operations

GRASS raster/imagery map processing is always performed in the current
region settings (see [g.region](g.region.md)), i.e. the current region
extent and current raster resolution is used. If the resolution differs
from that of the input raster map(s), on-the-fly resampling is performed
(nearest neighbor resampling). If this is not desired, the input map(s)
has/have to be resampled beforehand with one of the dedicated modules.

### Geocoding of imagery data

GRASS is able to geocode raster and image data of various types:

- unreferenced scanned maps by defining four corner points
  ([i.group](i.group.md), [i.target](i.target.md),
  [g.gui.gcp](g.gui.gcp.md), [i.rectify](i.rectify.md))
- unreferenced satellite data from optical and Radar sensors by defining
  a certain number of ground control points ([i.group](i.group.md),
  [i.target](i.target.md), [g.gui.gcp](g.gui.gcp.md),
  [i.rectify](i.rectify.md))
- interactive graphical [Ground Control Point (GCP)
  manager](wxGUI.gcp.md)
- orthophoto generation based on DEM: [i.ortho.photo](i.ortho.photo.md)
- digital handheld camera geocoding: modified procedure for
  [i.ortho.photo](i.ortho.photo.md)

### Visualizing (true) color composites

To quickly combine the first three channels to a near natural color
image, the GRASS command [d.rgb](d.rgb.md) can be used or the graphical
GIS manager ([wxGUI](wxGUI.md)). It assigns each channel to a color
which is then mixed while displayed. With a bit more work of tuning the
grey scales of the channels, nearly perfect colors can be achieved.
Channel histograms can be shown with [d.histogram](d.histogram.md).

### Calculation of vegetation indices

An example for indices derived from multispectral data is the NDVI
(normalized difference vegetation index). To study the vegetation status
with NDVI, the Red and the Near Infrared channels (NIR) are taken as
used as input for simple map algebra in the GRASS command
[r.mapcalc](r.mapcalc.md) (`ndvi = 1.0 * (nir - red)/(nir + red)`). With
[r.colors](r.colors.md) an optimized "ndvi" color table can be assigned
afterward. Also other vegetation indices can be generated likewise.

### Calibration of thermal channel

The encoded digital numbers of a thermal infrared channel can be
transformed to degree Celsius (or other temperature units) which
represent the temperature of the observed land surface. This requires a
few algebraic steps with [r.mapcalc](r.mapcalc.md) which are outlined in
the literature to apply gain and bias values from the image metadata.

### Image classification

Single and multispectral data can be classified to user defined land
use/land cover classes. In case of a single channel, segmentation will
be used. GRASS supports the following methods:

- Radiometric classification:
  - Unsupervised classification ([i.cluster](i.cluster.md),
    [i.maxlik](i.maxlik.md)) using the Maximum Likelihood classification
    method
  - Supervised classification ([i.gensig](i.gensig.md) or
    [g.gui.iclass](g.gui.iclass.md), [i.maxlik](i.maxlik.md)) using the
    Maximum Likelihood classification method
- Combined radiometric/geometric (segmentation based) classification:
  - Supervised classification ([i.gensigset](i.gensigset.md),
    [i.smap](i.smap.md))
- Object-oriented classification:
  - Unsupervised classification (segmentation based:
    [i.segment](i.segment.md))

Kappa statistic can be calculated to validate the results
([r.kappa](r.kappa.md)). Covariance/correlation matrices can be
calculated with [r.covar](r.covar.md).

Note - signatures generated for one scene are suitable for
classification of other scenes as long as they consist of same raster
bands (semantic labels match). This comes handy when classifying
multiple scenes from a single sensor taken in different areas or
different times.

### Image fusion

In case of using multispectral data, improvements of the resolution can
be gained by merging the panchromatic channel with color channels. GRASS
provides the HIS ([i.rgb.his](i.rgb.his.md), [i.his.rgb](i.his.rgb.md))
and the Brovey and PCA transform ([i.pansharpen](i.pansharpen.md))
methods.

### Radiometric corrections

Atmospheric effects can be removed with [i.atcorr](i.atcorr.md).
Correction for topographic/terrain effects is offered in
[i.topo.corr](i.topo.corr.md). Clouds in LANDSAT data can be identified
and removed with [i.landsat.acca](i.landsat.acca.md). Calibrated digital
numbers of LANDSAT and ASTER imagery may be converted to
top-of-atmosphere radiance or reflectance and temperature
([i.aster.toar](i.aster.toar.md), [i.landsat.toar](i.landsat.toar.md)).

### Time series processing

GRASS also offers support for time series processing
([r.series](r.series.md)). Statistics can be derived from a set of
coregistered input maps such as multitemporal satellite data. The common
univariate statistics and also linear regression can be calculated.

### Evapotranspiration modeling

In GRASS, several types of evapotranspiration (ET) modeling methods are
available:

- Reference ET: Hargreaves ([i.evapo.mh](i.evapo.mh.md)),
  Penman-Monteith ([i.evapo.pm](i.evapo.pm.md));
- Potential ET: Priestley-Taylor ([i.evapo.pt](i.evapo.pt.md));
- Actual ET: [i.evapo.time](i.evapo.time.md).

Evaporative fraction: [i.eb.evapfr](i.eb.evapfr.md),
[i.eb.hsebal01](i.eb.hsebal01.md).

### Energy balance

Emissivity can be calculated with [i.emissivity](i.emissivity.md).
Several modules support the calculation of the energy balance:

- Actual evapotranspiration for diurnal period
  ([i.eb.eta](i.eb.eta.md));
- Evaporative fraction and root zone soil moisture
  ([i.eb.evapfr](i.eb.evapfr.md));
- Sensible heat flux iteration ([i.eb.hsebal01](i.eb.hsebal01.md));
- Net radiation approximation ([i.eb.netrad](i.eb.netrad.md));
- Soil heat flux approximation
  ([i.eb.soilheatflux](i.eb.soilheatflux.md)).
