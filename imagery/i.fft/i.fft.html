<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM>i.fft</EM> is an image processing program based on the FFT algorithm
given by Frigo et al. (1998), that processes a single input raster map layer
(<B>input_image</B>) and constructs the real and imaginary Fourier
components in frequency space.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The real and imaginary components are stored as arrays of
doubles in the <EM>cell_misc</EM> directory (for use in the
inverse transform program,

<EM><A HREF="i.ifft.html">i.ifft</A></EM>),

and are also scaled and formatted into the
<B>real_image</B> and <B>imaginary_image</B> raster map
layers for inspection, masking, etc.  In these raster map
layers the low frequency components are in the center and
the high frequency components are toward the edges.  The
<B>input_image</B> need not be square;  before
processing, the X and Y dimensions of the
<B>input_image</B> are padded with zeroes to the next
highest power of two in extent (i.e., 256 x 256 is
processed at that size, but 200 x 400 is padded to 256 x
512).  The cell category values for viewing, etc., are
calculated by taking the natural log of the actual values
then rescaling to 255, or whatever optional range is given
on the command line, as suggested by Richards (1986).  A
color table is assigned to the resultant map layer.


<P>

The current geographic region and mask settings are
respected when reading the input file.  The presence of a
mask will, in general, make the resulting fast Fourier
transform invalid, or at least difficult to interpret.
