<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.eb.netrad</em> calculates the net radiation at the time of satellite
overpass, the way it is in the SEBAL model of Bastiaanssen (1995).

It takes input of Albedo, NDVI, Surface Skin temperature, time of satellite
overpass, surface emissivity, difference of temperature from surface skin and
about 2 m height (dT), instantaneous satellite overpass single-way atmospheric
transmissivity (tsw), Day of Year (DOY), and sun zenith angle.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<!-- rewrite too sloppy notes or move to addons -->
In the old methods, dT was taken as flat images (dT=5.0), if you don't have a dT
map from ground data, you would want to try something in this line, this is to
calculate atmospherical energy balance. In the same way, a standard tsw is used
in those equations. Refer to <tt>r_net.c</tt> for that and for other non-used equations,
but stored in there for further research convenience.

<h2>TODO</h2>
Add more explanations.
