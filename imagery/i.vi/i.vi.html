<h3>Background for users new to remote sensing</h3>

Vegetation Indices are often considered the entry point of remote 
sensing for Earth land monitoring. They are suffering from their 
success, in terms that often people tend to harvest satellite images 
from online sources and use them directly in this module.
<p>
From Digital number to Radiance:<br>
Satellite imagery is commonly stored in Digital Number (DN) for 
storage purposes; e.g., Landsat5 data is stored in 8bit values 
(ranging from 0 to 255), other satellites maybe stored in 10 or 16 
bits. If the data is provided in DN, this implies that this imagery 
is "uncorrected". What this means is that the image is what the 
satellite sees at its position and altitude in space (stored in DN). 
This is not the signal at ground yet. We call this data at-satellite 
or at-sensor. Encoded in the 8bits (or more) is the amount of energy 
sensed by the sensor inside the satellite platform. This energy is 
called radiance-at-sensor. Generally, satellites image providers 
encode the radiance-at-sensor into 8bit (or more) through an affine 
transform equation (y=ax+b). In case of using Landsat imagery, look 
at the <em>i.landsat.toar</em> for an easy way to transform DN to 
radiance-at-sensor. If using Aster data, try the <em>i.aster.toar</em> 
module.

<p>
From Radiance to Reflectance:<br>
Finally, once having obtained the radiance at sensor values, still 
the atmosphere is between sensor and Earth's surface. This fact 
needs to be corrected to account for the atmospheric interaction 
with the sun energy that the vegetation reflects back into space. 
This can be done in two ways for Landsat. The simple way is through 
<em>i.landsat.toar</em>, use e.g. the DOS correction. The more 
accurate way is by using <em>i.atcorr</em> (which works for many 
satellite sensors). Once the atmospheric correction has been applied 
to the satellite data, data vales are called surface reflectance. 
Surface reflectance is ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 theoretically (and 
absolutely). This level of data correction is the proper level of 
correction to use with <em>i.vi</em>.

<h3>Vegetation Indices</h3>

ARVI: Atmospheric Resistant Vegetation Index 
<p>
ARVI is resistant to atmospheric effects (in comparison to 
the NDVI) and is accomplished by a self correcting process 
for the atmospheric effect in the red channel, using the 
difference in the radiance between the blue and the red 
channels (Kaufman and Tanre 1996).

<div class="code"><pre>
ARVI = (nirchan - (2.0*redchan - bluechan)) / 
    ( nirchan + (2.0*redchan - bluechan))
arvi( redchan, nirchan, bluechan )
</pre></div>

<p>
DVI: Difference Vegetation Index

<div class="code"><pre>
DVI = ( nirchan - redchan )
dvi( redchan, nirchan )
</pre></div>

<p>
EVI: Enhanced Vegetation Index
<p>
The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) is an optimized index designed 
to enhance the vegetation signal with improved sensitivity in high 
biomass regions and improved vegetation monitoring through a 
de-coupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction in 
atmosphere influences (Huete A.R., Liu H.Q., Batchily K., van Leeuwen 
W. (1997). A comparison of vegetation indices global set of TM 
images for EOS-MODIS. Remote Sensing of Environment, 59:440-451).

<div class="code"><pre>
EVI = 2.5 * ( nirchan - redchan ) / 
    ( nirchan + 6.0 * redchan - 7.5 * bluechan + 1.0 )
evi( bluechan, redchan, nirchan )
</pre></div>

<p>
EVI2: Enhanced Vegetation Index 2
<p>
A 2-band EVI (EVI2), without a blue band, which has the best 
similarity with the 3-band EVI, particularly when atmospheric 
effects are insignificant and data quality is good (Zhangyan Jiang ; 
Alfredo R. Huete ; Youngwook Kim and Kamel Didan 2-band enhanced 
vegetation index without a blue band and its application to AVHRR 
data. Proc. SPIE 6679, Remote Sensing and Modeling of Ecosystems for 
Sustainability IV, 667905 (october 09, 2007)
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.734933">doi:10.1117/12.734933</a>).

<div class="code"><pre>
EVI2 = 2.5 * ( nirchan - redchan ) / 
    ( nirchan + 2.4 * redchan + 1.0 )

+1.5*nirchan+0.5*redchan) /(nirchan + redchan + 0.5)))-
