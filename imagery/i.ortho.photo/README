STATUS:
	The i.ortho.photo suite of modules has been temporarily disabled 
	from GRASS 7 as they are heavily dependent on the text-based
	Vask library and interactive XDRIVER monitors, both of which
	have been removed. As the modules are rewritten to run in non-
	interactive mode or with a wxPython frontend, they will be
	added back into GRASS 7. This work has been undertaken in the
	to some extent in the development branch.

AUTHORS:
	The orthophoto rectification programs went out under alpha in 4.0.
	It has since had bug fixes performed by OGI (Shapiro?) and also by
	the original programmer - Mike Baba of DBA Systems, Fairfax, VA.

GRASS GIS 4 to 6

The main program is i.ortho.photo which is just a menu driver for the 
following programs:

1 i.group
2 photo.target
3 photo.init
4 photo.camera
5 photo.elev
6 photo.2image
7 photo.2target
8 photo.rectify

The following GRASS 6 directories contain the source code:

	./menu:			main menu code       (-> menu/menu.c)

	./photo.target:		select target location and mapset

	./photo.elev:		select elevation model
 
	./photo.camera:		select a camera to use for parameters

	./photo.2image:		code for image to photo coordinate
				transformation

	./photo.init:		choose initial camera exposure station
				parameters

	./photo.2target:	computes photo to target location
				transformation parameters

	./photo.rectify:	does the actual image rectification
	
	./libes:		libraries for ortho programs
