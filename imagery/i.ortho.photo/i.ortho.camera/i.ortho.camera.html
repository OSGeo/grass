<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.ortho.camera</em> creates or modifies entries in a camera reference
file. For ortho-photo rectification, a camera reference file is required for
computation of scanned image to photo-coordinate transformation parameters.
There are two coordinate systems: The image coordinate system (in pixels)
and the photo coordinate system (in milli-meters). The inner orientation
establishes a relation between the pixels and the image coordinates with
help of fiducial marks.

<p>

The first prompt in the program will ask you for the name of 
the camera reference file to be created or modified.  You may
create a new camera reference file by entering a new name, or modify an
existing camera reference file by entering the name of an existing camera file.

<p>
After entering the camera file name, following menu is displayed:
<p>
Please provide the following information


<p>
<pre>

	CAMERA NAME:               <em>camera name</em>______
	CAMERA IDENTIFICATION:     <em>identification</em>___
	CALIBRATED FOCAL LENGTH mm.:_________________
	POINT OF SYMMETRY (X)   mm.:_________________
	POINT OF SYMMETRY (Y)   mm.:_________________
	MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FIDUCIALS:_________________

The camera name and identification describe the camera reference file.
The calibrated focal length and the point of symmetry are used in computing 
the photo-to-target transformation parameters.  These values should be entered
from the camera calibration report (usually available from the photograph 
supplier).

Military Geographical Survey (HMGS) and calibrated in December 1985</i>
<p>

The photo coordinate system origin is the so-called calibrated principal
point (PP, Principal Point of Symmetry) which is in the center of the image. 
The origin of the axes is at the intersection of the radii traced from the
fiducial marks. In the ideal case of no deviations in the camera (see camera
calibration certificate) the center is the origin and the values are 0 for
both X and Y of Point of Symmetry. But usually the principal point does not
fall on the intersection of the radii at the center of the picture. This
eccentricity is usually of the order of a few micrometers. <p>

You are then asked to enter the X and Y photo coordinates of each fiducial
as follows.
These fiducials (or reseau) marks are index marks imaged on film which serve
as reference photo coordinate system. The maximum number of fiducials will
determine the number of fiducial or reseau coordinate pairs to be entered
below. The origin is the center of the image (or the point of symmetry) and
X and Y are left-right and up-down. The order is up to the user, but must be
kept consistent throughout the rectification process.
<p>

On this screen you should enter the fiducial or
reseau photo-coordinates as given in the camera calibration report. The X,
and Y coordinates are in milli-meters from the principle point.
