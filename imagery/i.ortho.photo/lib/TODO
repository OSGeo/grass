>From grass64/TODO:

- merge of image libraries:
  A)
    - lib/imagery/: standard lib, in use (i.* except for i.points3, i.rectify3)
    - imagery/i.ortho.photo/libes/: standard lib, in use (i.ortho.photo, photo.*)
  B)
    - lib/image3/: never finished improvement which integrated the standard lib and
                   the ortho lib. Seems to provide also ortho rectification for
                   satellite data (i.points3, i.rectify3)

Possibly a lot is already done in lib/image3/ ?

- See
  https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Image_processing#Ideas_collection_for_improving_GRASS.27_Image_processing_capabilities
- image modules:
    - merge of i.rectify and i.rectify3
    - addition of new resampling algorithms such as bilinear, cubic convolution
      (take from r.proj?)
    - add other warping methods (maybe thin splines from GDAL?)
    - implement/finish linewise ortho-rectification of satellite data
    - Add support for > 8bit colors (only 0-255 supported currently)
