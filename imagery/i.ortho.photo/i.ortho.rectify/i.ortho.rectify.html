<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>i.photo.rectify</EM> rectifies an image by using the image to photo
coordinate transformation matrix created by <A HREF="i.photo.2image.html">i.photo.2image</A>
and the rectification parameters created by <A HREF="i.photo.2target.html">i.photo.2target</A>.
Rectification is the process by which the geometry of an image is made
planimetric.  This is accomplished by mapping an image from one coordinate
system to another. In <EM>i.photo.rectify</EM> the parameters computed by
<A HREF="i.photo.2image.html">i.photo.2image</A> and
<A HREF="i.photo.2target.html">i.photo.2target</A> are used in equations to
convert x,y image coordinates to standard map coordinates for each pixel in
the image.  The result is an image with a standard map coordinate system,
compensated for relief distortions and photographic tilt. Upon completion of
the program the rectified image is deposited in a previously targeted GRASS
LOCATION.
<P>
Images can be resampled with various different interpolation methods: 
nearest neighbor assignment, bilinear and bicubic interpolation. The 
bilinear and bicubic interpolation methods are also available with a
fallback option. These methods "fall back" to simpler interpolation 
methods along NULL borders. That is, from bicubic to bilinear to nearest.
<P>
The process may take an hour or more depending on the size of the image,
the speed of the computer, the number files, and the size and resolution
of the selected window.
<P>
The rectified image will be located in the target LOCATION when the program
is completed. The original unrectified files are not modified or removed.
<P>
The optional <em>angle</em> output holds the camera angle in degrees to
the local surface, considering local slope and aspect. A value of 90 
degrees indicates that the camera angle was orthogonal to the local 
surface, a value of 0 degrees indicates that the camera angle was 
parallel to the local surface and negative values indicate that the 
surface was invisible to the camera. As a rule of thumb, values below 30
degrees indicate problem areas where the orthorectified output will 
appear blurred. Because terrain shadowing effects are not considered, 
areas with high camera angles may also appear blurred if they are located
(viewed from the camera position) behind mountain ridges or peaks.
<P>
<EM>i.photo.rectify</EM> can be run directly, specifying options in the 
command line or the GUI, or it can be invoked as OPTION 8 through 
<A HREF="i.ortho.photo.html">i.ortho.photo</A>. If invoked though 
<A HREF="i.ortho.photo.html">i.ortho.photo</A>, an interactive terminal 
is used to determine the options.

<P> You are first asked if all images within the imagery group should 
be rectified. If this option is not chosen, you are asked to specify for 
each image within the imagery group whether it should be rectified or not.
<P>
More than one file may be rectified at a time. Each file
should have a unique output file name. The next prompt asks you for an 
extension to be appended to the rectified images.
<P>
The next prompt will ask you whether a camera angle map should be 
produced and if yes, what should be its name.
<P>
After that you are asked if overwriting existing maps in the target 
location and mapset should be allowed.
<P>
The next prompt asks you to select one of two windows:
<P>
<PRE>
      Please select one of the following options
      1.   Use the current window in the target location
      2.   Determine the smallest window which covers the image
      &gt;
</PRE>
<P>
If you choose option 2, you can also specify a desired target resolution.
<P>
<EM>i.photo.rectify</EM> will only rectify that portion of the
image that occurs within the chosen window.  Only that portion will be
relocated in the target database. It is therefore important to check the
current window in the target LOCATION if choice number one is selected.
<P>
Next you are asked to select an interpolation method.
<PRE>
      Please select one of the following interpolation methods
      1. nearest neighbor
      2. bilinear
      3. bicubic
      4. bilinear with fallback
      5. bicubic with fallback
      &gt;
</PRE>
<P>
The last prompt will ask you about the amount of memory to be used by
<EM>i.photo.rectify</EM>.
