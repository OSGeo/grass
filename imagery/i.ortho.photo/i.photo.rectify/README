1/2002: Markus Neteler

 - have updated write routines to GRASS 5 functions (taken from i.rectify2)
 - have changed elev reading from CELL to raster_type to support
   also FP elevations

12/2010: Markus Metz

 - sync'ed to i.rectify as far as possible
 - the module is now non-interactive and stand-alone: 
   typing i.photo.rectify on the commandline pops up a gui if GRASS is started with a gui
 - i.ortho.photo has a new interactive part to set the options for i.photo.rectify
