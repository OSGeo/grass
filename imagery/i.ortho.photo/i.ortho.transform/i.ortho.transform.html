<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.ortho.transform</em> is an utility to compute transformation
based upon GCPs and output error measurements.

<p>
If coordinates are given with the <b>input</b> file option or fed from 
<tt>stdin</tt>, both the input and the output format is "x y z" with one 
coordinate pair per line. Reverse transform is performed with the 
<b>-r</b> flag.

<p>
The <b>format</b> option determines how control points are printed out. 
A summary on the control points can be printed with the <b>-s</b> flag. 
The summary includes maximum deviation observed when transforming GCPs 
and overall RMS. The <b>format</b> option is ignored when coordinates 
are given with the <b>input</b> file option.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

Ortho-transformation is a 2-step transformation. First, source 
coordinates are transformed to sensor coordinates, then sensor 
coordinates are transformed to target coordinates.
