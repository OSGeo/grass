# This configuration should work for all Python library, Python scripts and
# wxPython GUI.
# Example for gui/wxpython:
#   pep8 --config=../../utils/pep8config.txt lmgr/

# A lot of errors need to be ignored now to avoid a large number of messages.
# Files need to be fixed one by one (without this configuration).

# Save this file as ~/.config/pep8 on Linux
