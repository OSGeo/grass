<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>v.dissolve</em> module is used to merge adjacent areas in a vector
map which share the same category value. The resulting merged area(s) retains
this category value. Alternatively an integer or string column can be defined
which is used to find adjacent polygons with identical attribute for common
boundary dissolving. In this case the categories are not retained, only the
values of the new key column. See the <em>v.reclass</em> help page for details.

<h3>Merging behavior</h3>

Multiple areas with the same category or the same attribute value
which are not adjacent are merged together into one entity
which consists of multiple areas, i.e., a multipolygon.

<h3>Attribute aggregation</h3>

<p>
Attributes of merged areas can be aggregated using various aggregation methods
such as <em>sum</em> and <em>mean</em>. The specific methods available depend
on the backend used for aggregation. Two aggregate backends (specified in
<b>aggregate_backend</b>) are available, <em>univar</em> and <em>sql</em>.
When <em>univar</em> is used, the methods available are the ones
which <em>v.db.univar</em> uses by default,
i.e., <em>n</em>, <em>min</em>, <em>max</em>, <em>range</em>,
<em>mean</em>, <em>mean_abs</em>, <em>variance</em>, <em>stddev</em>,
<em>coef_var</em>, and <em>sum</em>.
When the <em>sql</em> backend is used, the methods in turn depends on the SQL
database backend used for the attribute table of the input vector.
For SQLite, it is at least the following
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html">build-in aggregate functions</a>:
<em>count</em>, <em>min</em>, <em>max</em>,
<em>avg</em>, <em>sum</em>, and <em>total</em>.
For PostgreSQL, the list of
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html">aggregate functions</a>
is much longer and includes, e.g., <em>count</em>, <em>min</em>, <em>max</em>,
<em>avg</em>, <em>sum</em>, <em>stddev</em>, and <em>variance</em>.
The <em>sql</em> aggregate backend, regardless of the underlying database,
will typically perform significantly better than the <em>univar</em> backend.

<p>
Aggregate methods are specified by name in <b>aggregate_methods</b>
or using SQL syntax in <b>aggregate_columns</b>.
If <b>result_columns</b> is provided including type information
and the <em>sql</em> backend is used,
<b>aggregate_columns</b> can contain SQL syntax specifying both columns
and the functions applied, e.g.,
<code>aggregate_columns="sum(cows) / sum(animals)"</code>.
In this case, <b>aggregate_methods</b> should to be omitted.
This provides the highest flexibility and it is suitable for scripting.

<p>
The backend is, by default, determined automatically based on the requested
methods. Specifically, the <em>sql</em> backend is used by default,
but when a method is not one of the SQLite build-in aggregate functions
and, at the same time, is available with the <em>univar</em> backend,
the <em>univar</em> backed is used.
The default behavior is intended for interactive use and testing.
For scripting and other automated usage, specifying the backend explicitly
is strongly recommended.

<p>
For convenience, certain methods, namely <em>n</em>, <em>count</em>,
<em>mean</em>, and <em>avg</em>, are converted to the appropriate name 
for the selected backend. However, for scripting, it is recommended to
specify the appropriate method (function) name for the backend, as the 
conversion is a heuristic that may change in the future.

<p>
If only <b>aggregate_columns</b> is provided, methods default to
<em>n</em>, <em>min</em>, <em>max</em>, <em>mean</em>, and <em>sum</em>.
If the <em>univar</em> backend is specified, all the available methods
for the <em>univar</em> backend are used.

<p>
If the <b>result_columns</b> is not provided, each method is applied to each
specified column producing result columns for all combinations. These result
columns have auto-generated names based on the aggregate column and method.
If the <b>result_column</b> is provided, each method is applied only once
to the matching column in the aggregate column list and the result will be
available under the name of the matching result column. In other words, number
of items in <b>aggregate_columns</b>, <b>aggregate_methods</b> (unless omitted),
and <b>result_column</b> needs to match and no
combinations are created on the fly.
For scripting, it is recommended to specify all resulting column names,
while for interactive use, automatically created combinations are expected
to be beneficial, especially for exploratory analysis.

<p>
Type of the result column is determined based on the method selected.
For <em>n</em> and <em>count</em>, the type is INTEGER and for all other
methods, it is DOUBLE. Aggregate methods which produce other types
require the type to be specified as part of the <b>result_columns</b>.
A type can be provided in <b>result_columns</b> using the SQL syntax
<code>name type</code>, e.g., <code>sum_of_values double precision</code>.
Type specification is mandatory when SQL syntax is used in
<b>aggregate_columns</b> (and <b>aggregate_methods</b> is omitted).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

GRASS defines a vector area as composite entity consisting of a set of
closed boundaries and a centroid. The centroids must contain a
category number
(see <em>v.centroids</em>), this number is linked to area attributes and
database links.
<p>Multiple attributes may be linked to a single vector entity through
numbered fields referred to as layers. Refer to <em>v.category</em> for
more details.

<p>Merging of areas can also be accomplished using
<tt>v.extract -d</tt> which provides some additional options.
In fact, <em>v.dissolve</em> is simply a
front-end to that module. The use of the <em>column</em> parameter
adds a call to <em>v.reclass</em> before.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Basic use</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.dissolve input=undissolved output=dissolved
</pre></div>

<h3>Dissolving based on column attributes</h3>

North Carolina data set:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.copy vect=soils_general,mysoils_general
v.dissolve mysoils_general output=mysoils_general_families column=GSL_NAME
</pre></div>

<h3>Dissolving adjacent SHAPE files to remove tile boundaries</h3>

If tile boundaries of adjacent maps (e.g. CORINE Landcover SHAPE files)
have to be removed, an extra step is required to remove duplicated
boundaries:

<div class="code"><pre>
# patch tiles after import:
v.patch -e `g.list type=vector pat="clc2000_*" separator=","` out=clc2000_patched

# remove duplicated tile boundaries:
v.clean clc2000_patched out=clc2000_clean tool=snap,break,rmdupl thresh=.01

# dissolve based on column attributes:
v.dissolve input=clc2000_clean output=clc2000_final col=CODE_00
</pre></div>

<h3>Attribute aggregation</h3>

While dissolving, we can aggregate attribute values of the original features.
Let's aggregate area in acres (ACRES) of all municipal boundaries
(boundary_municp) in the full NC dataset while dissolving common boundaries
based on the name in the DOTURBAN_N column
(long lines are split with backslash marking continued line as in Bash):

<div class="code"><pre>
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities \
    aggregate_columns=ACRES
</pre></div>

To inspect the result, we will use <em>v.db.select</em> retrieving only one row
for <code>DOTURBAN_N == 'Wadesboro'</code>:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.db.select municipalities where="DOTURBAN_N == 'Wadesboro'" separator=tab
</pre></div>

The resulting table may look like this:

<div class="code"><pre>
cat  DOTURBAN_N    ACRES_n    ACRES_min    ACRES_max    ACRES_mean    ACRES_sum
66   Wadesboro     2          634.987      3935.325     2285.156      4570.312
</pre></div>

The above created multiple columns for each of the statistics computed
by default. We can limit the number of statistics computed by specifying
the method which should be used:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_2 \
    aggregate_columns=ACRES aggregate_methods=sum
</pre></div>

The above gives a single column with the sum for all values in the ACRES column
for each group of original features which had the same value in the DOTURBAN_N
column and are now dissolved (merged) into one.

<h3>Aggregating multiple attributes</h3>

Expanding on the previous example, we can compute values for multiple columns
at once by adding more columns to the <b>aggregate_columns</b> option.
We will compute average of values in the NEW_PERC_G column:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_3 \
    aggregate_columns=ACRES,NEW_PERC_G aggregate_methods=sum,avg
</pre></div>

By default, all methods specified in the <b>aggregate_methods</b> are applied
to all columns, so result of the above is four columns.
While this is convenient for getting multiple statistics for similar columns
(e.g. averages and standard deviations of multiple population statistics columns),
in our case, each column is different and each aggregate method should be
applied only to its corresponding column.

<p>
The <em>v.dissolve</em> module will apply each aggregate method only to the
corresponding column when column names for the results are specified manually
with the <b>result_columns</b> option:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_4 \
    aggregate_columns=ACRES,NEW_PERC_G aggregate_methods=sum,avg \
    result_columns=acres,new_perc_g
</pre></div>

Now we have full control over what columns are created, but we also need to specify
an aggregate method for each column even when the aggregate methods are the same:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_5 \
    aggregate_columns=ACRES,DOTURBAN_N,TEXT_NAME aggregate_methods=sum,count,count \
    result_columns=acres,number_of_parts,named_parts
</pre></div>

While it is often not necessary to specify aggregate methods or names for
interactive exploratory analysis, specifying both <b>aggregate_methods</b>
and <b>result_columns</b> manually is a best practice for scripting
(unless SQL syntax is used for <b>aggregate_columns</b>, see below).

<h3>Aggregating using SQL syntax</h3>

The aggregation can be done also using the full SQL syntax and set of aggregate
functions available for a given attribute database backend.
Here, we will assume the default SQLite database backend for attribute.

<p>
Modifying the previous example, we will now specify the SQL aggregate function calls
explicitly instead of letting <em>v.dissolve</em> generate them for us.
We will compute sum of the ACRES column using <code>sum(ACRES)</code>
(alternatively, we could use SQLite specific <code>total(ACRES)</code>
which returns zero even when all values are NULL).
Further, we will count number of aggregated (i.e., dissolved) parts using
<code>count(*)</code> which counts all rows regardless of NULL values.
Then, we will count all unique names of parts as distinguished by
the MB_NAME column using <code>count(distinct MB_NAME)</code>.
Finally, we will collect all these names into a comma-separated list using
<code>group_concat(MB_NAME)</code>:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_6 \
    aggregate_columns="total(ACRES),count(*),count(distinct MB_NAME),group_concat(MB_NAME)" \
    result_columns="acres REAL,named_parts INTEGER,unique_names INTEGER,names TEXT"
</pre></div>

Here, <em>v.dissolve</em> doesn't make any assumptions about the resulting
column types, so we specified both named and the type of each column.

<p>
When working with general SQL syntax, <em>v.dissolve</em> turns off its checks for
number of aggregate and result columns to allow for all SQL syntax to be used
for aggregate columns. This allows us to use also functions with multiple parameters,
for example specify separator to be used with <em>group_concat</em>:

<div class="code"><pre>
    v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_7 \
        aggregate_columns="group_concat(MB_NAME, ';')" \
        result_columns="names TEXT"
</pre></div>

To inspect the result, we will use <em>v.db.select</em> retrieving only one row
for <code>DOTURBAN_N == 'Wadesboro'</code>:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.db.select municipalities_7 where="DOTURBAN_N == 'Wadesboro'" separator=tab
</pre></div>

The resulting table may look like this:

<div class="code"><pre>
cat	DOTURBAN_N	names
66	Wadesboro	Wadesboro;Lilesville
</pre></div>
