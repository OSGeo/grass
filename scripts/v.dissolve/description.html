<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <EM>v.dissolve</EM> module is used to merge adjacent areas in a vector
map which share the same category value. The resulting merged area(s) retains
this category value. Optionally, a column can be defined which is used
to find adjacent polygons with identical attribute for common boundary
dissolving.

GRASS defines a vector area as composite entity consisting of a set of
closed boundaries and a centroid. The centroids must contain a
category number
(see <em><a href="v.centroids.html">v.centroids</a></em>), this number
is linked to area attributes and database links.

Multiple attributes may be linked to a single vector entity through
numbered fields referred to as layers. Refer
to <em><a href="v.category.html">v.category</a></em> for more details.

<P>
Merging of areas can also be accomplished using
"<em>v.extract <b>-d</b></em>" which provides some additional options.
In fact, <a href="v.dissolve.html">v.dissolve</a> is simply a
front-end to that module. The use of the <EM>column</EM> parameter
adds a call to <em><a href="v.reclass.html">v.reclass</a></em> before.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Basic use</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.dissolve input=undissolved output=dissolved
</pre></div>

<h3>Dissolving based on column attributes</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
# check column names:
v.info -c polbnda_italy

# dissolve based on column attributes:
v.dissolve input=polbnda_italy output=pol_italy_regions col=vmap_nam
</pre></div>

<h3>Dissolving adjacent SHAPE files to remove tile boundaries</h3>

If tile boundaries of adjacent maps (e.g. CORINE Landcover SHAPE files)
have to be removed, an extra step is required to remove duplicated
boundaries:

<div class="code"><pre>
# patch tiles after import:
v.patch -e `g.mlist type=vect pat="clc2000_*" sep=,` out=clc2000_patched

# remove duplicated tile boundaries:
v.clean clc2000_patched out=clc2000_clean tool=snap,break,rmdupl thresh=.01

# dissolve based on column attributes:
v.dissolve input=clc2000_clean output=clc2000_final col=CODE_00
</pre></div>
