## DESCRIPTION

The *v.dissolve* module is used to merge adjacent or overlapping
features in a vector map that share the same category value. The
resulting merged feature(s) retain this category value.

*Figure: Areas with the same attribute value (first image) are merged
into one (second image).*

Instead of dissolving features based on the category values, the user
can define an integer or string column using the **column** parameter.
In that case, features that share the same value in that column are
dissolved. Note, the newly created layer does not retain the category
(cat) values from the input layer.

Note that multiple areas with the same category or the same attribute
value that are not adjacent are merged into one entity, which consists
of multiple features, i.e., a multipart feature.

### Attribute aggregation

The attributes of merged areas can be aggregated using various
aggregation methods. The specific methods available depend on the
backend used for aggregation. Two aggregate backends (specified with the
**aggregate_backend** parameter) are available, *univar* and *sql*. The
backend is determined automatically based on the requested methods. When
the function is one of the *SQL* build-in aggregate functions, the *sql*
backend is used. Otherwise, the *univar* backend is used.

The default behavior is intended for interactive use and testing. For
scripting and other automated usage, explicitly specifying the backend
with the **aggregate_backend** parameter is strongly recommended. When
choosing, note that the *sql* aggregate backend, regardless of the
underlying database, will typically perform significantly better than
the *univar* backend.

#### Aggregation using univar backend

When *univar* is used, the methods available are the ones which
*v.db.univar* uses by default, i.e., *n*, *min*, *max*, *range*, *mean*,
*mean_abs*, *variance*, *stddev*, *coef_var*, and *sum*.

#### Aggregation using sql backend

When the *sql* backend is used, the methods depend on the SQL database
backend used for the attribute table of the input vector. For SQLite,
there are at least the following [built-in aggregate
functions](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html): *count*, *min*,
*max*, *avg*, *sum*, and *total*. For PostgreSQL, the list of [aggregate
functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html)
is much longer and includes, e.g., *count*, *min*, *max*, *avg*, *sum*,
*stddev*, and *variance*.

#### Defining the aggregation method

If only the parameter **aggregate_columns** is provided, all the
following aggregation statistics are calculated: *n*, *min*, *max*,
*mean*, and *sum*. If the *univar* backend is specified, all the
available methods for the *univar* backend are used.

The **aggregate_methods** parameter can be used to specify which
aggregation statistics should be computed. Alternatively, the parameter
**aggregate_columns** can be used to specify the method using SQL
syntax. This provides the highest flexibility, and it is suitable for
scripting. The SQL statement should specify both the column and the
functions applied, e.g.,

```sh
aggregate_columns="sum(cows) / sum(animals)".
```

Note that when the **aggregate_columns** parameter is used, the *sql*
backend should be used. In addition, the **aggregate_columns** and
**aggregate_methods** cannot be used together.

For convenience, certain methods, namely *n*, *count*, *mean*, and
*avg*, are automatically converted to the appropriate name for the
selected backend. However, for scripting, it is recommended to specify
the appropriate method (function) name for the backend, as the
conversion is a heuristic that may change in the future.

If the **result_columns** is not provided, each method is applied to
each column specified by **aggregate_columns**. This results in a column
for each of the combinations. These result columns have auto-generated
names based on the aggregate column and method. For example, setting the
following parameters:

```sh
aggregate_columns=A,B
aggregate_methods=sum,n
```

results in the following columns: A_sum, A_n, B_sum, B_n. See the
Examples section.

If the **result_column** is provided, each method is applied only once
to the matching column in the aggregate column list, and the result will
be available under the name of the matching result column. For example,
setting the following parameter:

```sh
aggregate_columns=A,B
aggregate_methods=sum,max
result_column=sum_a, n_b
```

results in the column *sum_a* with the sum of the values of *A* and the
column *n_b* with the max of *B*. Note that the number of items in
**aggregate_columns**, **aggregate_methods** (unless omitted), and
**result_column** needs to match, and no combinations are created on the
fly. See the Examples section.

For scripting, it is recommended to specify all resulting column names,
while for interactive use, automatically created combinations are
expected to be beneficial, especially for exploratory analysis.

The type of the result column is determined based on the method
selected. For *n* and *count*, the type is INTEGER and for all other
methods, it is DOUBLE. Aggregate methods that produce other types
require the type to be specified as part of the **result_columns**. A
type can be provided in **result_columns** using the SQL syntax
`name type`, e.g., `sum_of_values double precision`. Type specification
is mandatory when SQL syntax is used in **aggregate_columns** (and
**aggregate_methods** is omitted).

## NOTES

GRASS defines a vector area as a composite entity consisting of a set of
closed boundaries and a centroid. The centroids must contain a category
number (see *v.centroids*), this number is linked to area attributes and
database links.

Multiple attributes may be linked to a single vector entity through
numbered fields referred to as layers. Refer to *v.category* for more
details.

Merging of areas can also be accomplished using `v.extract -d` which
provides some additional options. In fact, *v.dissolve* is simply a
front-end to that module. The use of the *column* parameter adds a call
to *v.reclass* before.

## EXAMPLES

### Basic use

```sh
v.dissolve input=undissolved output=dissolved
```

### Dissolving based on column attributes

North Carolina data set:

```sh
g.copy vect=soils_general,mysoils_general
v.dissolve mysoils_general output=mysoils_general_families column=GSL_NAME
```

### Dissolving adjacent SHAPE files to remove tile boundaries

If tile boundaries of adjacent maps (e.g. CORINE Landcover SHAPE files)
have to be removed, an extra step is required to remove duplicated
boundaries:

```sh
# patch tiles after import:
v.patch -e `g.list type=vector pat="clc2000_*" separator=","` out=clc2000_patched

# remove duplicated tile boundaries:
v.clean clc2000_patched out=clc2000_clean tool=snap,break,rmdupl thresh=.01

# dissolve based on column attributes:
v.dissolve input=clc2000_clean output=clc2000_final col=CODE_00
```

### Aggregating attributes

While dissolving, we can aggregate attribute values of the original
features. Let's aggregate area in acres (ACRES) of all municipal
boundaries (boundary_municp) in the full NC dataset while dissolving
common boundaries based on the name in the DOTURBAN_N column (long lines
are split with backslash marking continued line as in Bash):

```sh
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities \
    aggregate_columns=ACRES
```

To inspect the result, we will use *v.db.select* retrieving only one row
for `DOTURBAN_N == 'Wadesboro'`:

```sh
v.db.select municipalities where="DOTURBAN_N == 'Wadesboro'" separator=tab
```

The resulting table may look like this:

```sh
cat  DOTURBAN_N    ACRES_n    ACRES_min    ACRES_max    ACRES_mean    ACRES_sum
66   Wadesboro     2          634.987      3935.325     2285.156      4570.312
```

The above created multiple columns for each of the statistics computed
by default. We can limit the number of statistics computed by specifying
the method which should be used:

```sh
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_2 \
    aggregate_columns=ACRES aggregate_methods=sum
```

The above gives a single column with the sum for all values in the ACRES
column for each group of original features which had the same value in
the DOTURBAN_N column and are now dissolved (merged) into one.

### Aggregating multiple attributes

Expanding on the previous example, we can compute values for multiple
columns at once by adding more columns to the **aggregate_columns**
option. We will compute average of values in the NEW_PERC_G column:

```sh
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_3 \
    aggregate_columns=ACRES,NEW_PERC_G aggregate_methods=sum,avg
```

By default, all methods specified in the **aggregate_methods** are
applied to all columns, so result of the above is four columns. While
this is convenient for getting multiple statistics for similar columns
(e.g. averages and standard deviations of multiple population statistics
columns), in our case, each column is different and each aggregate
method should be applied only to its corresponding column.

The *v.dissolve* module will apply each aggregate method only to the
corresponding column when column names for the results are specified
manually with the **result_columns** option:

```sh
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_4 \
    aggregate_columns=ACRES,NEW_PERC_G aggregate_methods=sum,avg \
    result_columns=acres,new_perc_g
```

Now we have full control over what columns are created, but we also need
to specify an aggregate method for each column even when the aggregate
methods are the same:

```sh
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_5 \
    aggregate_columns=ACRES,DOTURBAN_N,TEXT_NAME aggregate_methods=sum,count,count \
    result_columns=acres,number_of_parts,named_parts
```

While it is often not necessary to specify aggregate methods or names
for interactive exploratory analysis, specifying both
**aggregate_methods** and **result_columns** manually is a best practice
for scripting (unless SQL syntax is used for **aggregate_columns**, see
below).

### Aggregating using SQL syntax

The aggregation can be done also using the full SQL syntax and set of
aggregate functions available for a given attribute database backend.
Here, we will assume the default SQLite database backend for attribute.

Modifying the previous example, we will now specify the SQL aggregate
function calls explicitly instead of letting *v.dissolve* generate them
for us. We will compute sum of the ACRES column using `sum(ACRES)`
(alternatively, we could use SQLite specific `total(ACRES)` which
returns zero even when all values are NULL). Further, we will count
number of aggregated (i.e., dissolved) parts using `count(*)` which
counts all rows regardless of NULL values. Then, we will count all
unique names of parts as distinguished by the MB_NAME column using
`count(distinct MB_NAME)`. Finally, we will collect all these names into
a comma-separated list using `group_concat(MB_NAME)`:

```sh
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_6 \
    aggregate_columns="total(ACRES),count(*),count(distinct MB_NAME),group_concat(MB_NAME)" \
    result_columns="acres REAL,named_parts INTEGER,unique_names INTEGER,names TEXT"
```

Here, *v.dissolve* doesn't make any assumptions about the resulting
column types, so we specified both named and the type of each column.

When working with general SQL syntax, *v.dissolve* turns off its checks
for number of aggregate and result columns to allow for all SQL syntax
to be used for aggregate columns. This allows us to use also functions
with multiple parameters, for example specify separator to be used with
*group_concat*:

```sh
v.dissolve input=boundary_municp column=DOTURBAN_N output=municipalities_7 \
    aggregate_columns="group_concat(MB_NAME, ';')" \
    result_columns="names TEXT"
```

To inspect the result, we will use *v.db.select* retrieving only one row
for `DOTURBAN_N == 'Wadesboro'`:

```sh
v.db.select municipalities_7 where="DOTURBAN_N == 'Wadesboro'" separator=tab
```

The resulting table may look like this:

```sh
cat DOTURBAN_N  names
66  Wadesboro   Wadesboro;Lilesville
```
