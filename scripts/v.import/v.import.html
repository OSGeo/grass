<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.import</em> imports vector data from files and database connections
supported by the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">OGR</a> library) into the
current location and mapset. If the projection of the input
does not match the projection of the location, the input is reprojected
into the current location. In case that the projection of the input map
does match the projection of the location, the input is imported directly.

<h3>Supported Vector Formats</h3>

<em>v.import</em> uses the OGR library which supports various vector data
formats including <a href="http://www.gdal.org/drv_shapefile.html">ESRI
Shapefile</a>, <a href="http://www.gdal.org/drv_mitab.html">Mapinfo
File</a>, UK .NTF, SDTS, TIGER, IHO S-57 (ENC), DGN, GML, GPX, AVCBin, REC,
Memory, OGDI, and PostgreSQL, depending on the local OGR installation.
For details see the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html">OGR web
site</a>. The OGR (Simple Features Library) is part of the
<a href="http://www.gdal.org">GDAL</a> library, hence GDAL needs to be
installed to use <em>v.in.ogr</em>.

<p>
The list of actually supported formats can be printed by <b>-f</b> flag.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>v.import</em> checks the projection metadata of the dataset to be
imported against the current location's projection. If not identical a
related error message is shown.
<br>
To override this projection check (i.e. to use current location's projection)
by assuming that the dataset has the same projection as the current location
the <b>-o</b> flag can be used. This is also useful when geodata to be
imported do not contain any projection metadata at all. The user must be
sure that the projection is identical in order to avoid to introduce data
errors.

<h3>Topology cleaning</h3>

When importing polygons, non-topological polygons are converted to 
topological areas. If the input polygons contain errors (unexpected 
overlapping areas, small gaps between polygons, or warnings about being 
unable to calculate centroids), the import might need to be repeated 
using a <em>snap</em> value as suggested in the output messages. The
default value of <tt>snap=-1</tt> means that no snapping will be done.

<!-- TODO: add hints for latlong -->

<p>
The <em>snap</em> threshold defines the maximal distance from one to another
vertex in map units (for latitude-longitude locations in degrees). If there
is no other vertex within <em>snap</em> distance, no snapping will be done.
Note that a too large value can severely damage area topology, beyond repair.
<p>
<i>Post-processing:</i> Snapped boundaries may need to be cleaned with
<em>v.clean</em>, using its tools <em>break,rmdupl,rmsa</em>. For details,
refer to the <em>v.clean</em> manual page.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<div class="code"><pre>
# import SHAPE file at full extent and reproject to current location projection
v.import input=research_area.shp output=research_area extent=input
</pre></div>

<h2>ERROR MESSAGES</h2>

<h3>SQL syntax errors</h3>

Depending on the currently selected SQL driver, error messages such as follows may arise:

<div class="code"><pre>
DBMI-SQLite driver error:
Error in sqlite3_prepare():
near "ORDER": syntax error
</pre></div>

Or:

<div class="code"><pre>
DBMI-DBF driver error:
SQL parser error:
syntax error, unexpected DESC, expecting NAME processing 'DESC
</pre></div>

This indicates that a column name in the input dataset corresponds to a reserved
SQL word (here: 'ORDER' and 'DESC' respectively). A different column name has to be
used in this case. The <b>columns</b> parameter can be used to assign different
column names on the fly in order to avoid using reserved SQL words.

For a list of SQL reserved words for SQLite (the default driver),
see <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_keywords.html">here</a>.

<h3>Projection errors</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
Projection of dataset does not appear to match the current location.
</pre></div>

Here you need to create or use a location whose projection matches that
of the vector data you wish to import. Try using <b>location</b> parameter to
create a new location based upon the projection information in the file. If
desired, you can then re-project it to another location
with <em><a href="v.proj.html">v.proj</a></em>.
