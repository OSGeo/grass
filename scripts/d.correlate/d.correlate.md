## DESCRIPTION

*d.correlate* displays graphically the results of a *r.stats* analysis
run on two raster map layers. This module highlights the correlation (or
lack of it) among data layers (scattergram).

The results are displayed in the active display frame on the user's
graphics monitor. *d.correlate* erases the active frame before
displaying results. If no graphics monitor is open, a file `map.png` is
generated in the current directory.

## NOTES

If three or four map layers are specified, the correlation among each
combination of two data layers is displayed.

## EXAMPLE

Scatterplot of two LANDSAT TM7 channels (North Carolina sample dataset):

```sh
g.region raster=lsat7_2002_30 -p
d.correlate map=lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40
```
