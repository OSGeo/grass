<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.mask</em> facilitates the creation and management of a raster mask to
control raster operations.
While the computational region specifies the extent (rectangular bounding box)
and resolution, the mask specifies the area that should be considered for
the operations and area which should be ignored.
The mask is represented as a raster map called <code>MASK</code> by default.

<p>
The mask is applied when <em>reading</em> an existing GRASS raster map,
for example when used as an input map in a module. The mask will block out
certain areas of a raster map from analysis and/or display, by "hiding" them
from sight of other GRASS modules. Data falling within the boundaries of the
mask can be modified and operated upon by other GRASS raster modules; data
falling outside the mask is treated as if it were NULL.
<p>
By default, <em>r.mask</em> converts any non-NULL value in the input map,
including zero, to 1. All these areas will be part of the mask (see the notes
for more details). To only convert specific values (or range of values) to 1
and the rest to NULL, use the <em>maskcats</em> parameter.
<p>
Because the mask raster map created with <em>r.mask</em> is actually only
a reclass map named <code>MASK</code> by default, it can be copied, renamed,
removed, and used in analyses, just like other GRASS raster maps.
<p>
The user should be aware that a mask remains in place until it is removed
or renamed. To remove a mask and restore
raster operations to normal (i.e., all cells of the current region), remove the
mask by setting the <b>-r</b> flag (<code>r.mask -r</code>).
Alternatively, a mask can be removed using <em>g.remove</em> or by renaming it
to any other name with <em>g.rename</em>.
<p>
The <code>GRASS_MASK</code> environment variable can be used to specify
the raster map which will be used as a mask. If the environment variable is
not defined, the name <code>MASK</code> is used instead.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The above method for specifying a "mask" may seem counterintuitive. Areas
inside the mask are not hidden; areas outside the mask will be ignored until
the mask is removed.
<p>
<em>r.mask</em> uses <em>r.reclass</em> to create a reclassification of an
existing raster map and names it <code>MASK</code> by default.
A reclass map takes up less
space, but is affected by any changes to the underlying map from which it was
created. The user can select category values from the input raster to use in the
mask with the <em>maskcats</em> parameter; if <em>r.mask</em> is run from the
command line, the category values listed in <em>maskcats</em> must be quoted
(see example below). Note that the <em>maskcats</em> can only be used if the
input map is an integer map.

<h3>Different ways to create a mask</h3>

Mask can be created using <em>r.mask</em> or by creating a mask raster map
directly.

<p>
The <em>r.mask</em> tool creates a mask with values 1 and NULL.
By default, <em>r.mask</em> converts all non-NULL cells to 1.
If a raster with ones (1) and NULLs values is used with <em>r.mask</em>, all
raster cells with value 1 will be included in the computation,
while those with NULL will be masked out.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.mapcalc -s "map1 = if(row() &lt; col(), 1, null())"
r.mask raster=map1
</pre></div>

If a binary map with zeros and ones as values is used with <em>r.mask</em>,
and both NULLs and zeros should be masked out, the <b>maskcats</b> parameter
can be used to specify the values that should be masked out:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.mapcalc -s "map2 = if(row() &lt; col(), 1, 0)"
r.mask raster=map2 maskcats="0"
</pre></div>

<p>
Mask can also be created directly using any tools that have a raster as
output, by naming the output raster <code>MASK</code> (or whatever the
<code>GRASS_MASK</code> environment variable is set to).
Both NULLs and zeros will be masked out in the raster mask.
This allows for creation of a simple binary raster with only ones and zeros
where cells with zeros in the mask raster are excluded from the computation
(behaving as if they were NULL).
A raster with zeros and ones can be created and used directly as a mask
by naming the output raster <code>MASK</code>, e.g., using raster algebra:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.mapcalc -s "MASK = if(row() &lt; col(), 1, 0)"
</pre></div>

<h3>Handling of floating-point maps</h3>

<em>r.mask</em> treats floating-point maps the same as integer maps (except that
floating maps are not allowed in combination with the <em>maskcats</em>
parameter); all non-NULL values of the input raster map are converted to 1 and
are thus part of the mask. In the example below, all raster cells are part of
the mask, i.e., nothing is blocked out from analysis and/or display.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.mapcalc -s "map3 = rand(0.0,1.0)"
r.mask raster=map3
</pre></div>

However, when using another method than <em>r.mask</em> to create a mask,
the user should be aware that the mask is read as an integer map. If mask is
a floating-point map, the values will be converted to integers using
the map's quantisation rules (this defaults to round-to-nearest, but can be
changed with r.quant).

<div class="code"><pre>
r.mapcalc -s "map4 = rand(0.0,1.0)"
g.copy raster=map4,MASK
</pre></div>

In the example above, raster cells with a rounded value of 1 are part of
the mask, while raster cells with a rounded value of 0 are converted to NULL
and consequently blocked out from analysis and/or display.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

The examples are based on the North Carolina sample dataset.
<p>
Create a raster mask, for constraining the calculation of
univariate statistics of the elevation values for "lakes":
<div class="code"><pre>
# set computation region to lakes raster map
g.region raster=lakes -p
# use lakes as mask
r.mask raster=lakes
# get statistics for elevation pixels of lakes:
r.univar elevation
</pre></div>

Remove the raster mask with the -r flag:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.mask -r
</pre></div>

Creating a mask from selected categories in the North Carolina
'geology_30m' raster map:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=geology_30m -p
r.category geology_30m
d.mon wx0
d.rast geology_30m
r.mask raster=geology_30m maskcats="217 thru 720"
d.mon wx0
d.rast geology_30m
</pre></div>
