<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<EM><b>r.fillnulls</b></EM>  - Fills NULL (no data areas) in input map and
stores filled map to a new output map. The fill data are interpolated 
from the no data area boundaries buffer using <EM>v.surf.rst</EM>
spline interpolation.<br>

<EM>(GRASS Shell Script)</EM>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Each area boundary buffer is set to three times the map resolution to get nominally
three points around the edge. This way the algorithm interpolates into the hole with
a trained slope and curvature at the edges, in order to avoid that such a flat plane
is generated in a hole.
<P>
During the interpolation following warning may occur:<p>

<tt>
Warning: strip exists with insufficient data<br>
Warning: taking too long to find points for interpolation--please change
the region to area where your points are</tt>
<p>

This warning is generated if large data holes exist within the surface.
As the idea of <em>r.fillnulls</em> is to fill such holes, the user may
ignore the warning. The interpolation will be continued. However, the user
may pay attention to below notes.

<H2>ATTENTION</H2>

The algorithm is based on <EM><A HREF="v.surf.rst.html">v.surf.rst</A></EM>
regularized splines with tension interpolation module which interpolates the
raster cell values for NULL data areas from the boundary values of the NULL
data area. An eventual raster MASK is respected during the NULL data area(s)
filling. The interpolated values are patched into the NULL data area(s) of
the input map and saved into a new raster map.

<H2>WARNING</H2>

Depending on the shape of the NULL data area(s) problems may occur due to an
insufficient number of input cell values for the interpolation process. Most
problems will occur if a NULL data area reaches a large amount of the map
boundary. The user will have to carefully check the result using
<EM><a href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</A></EM> (generating a difference map to the
input map) and/or <EM><A HREF="d.what.rast.html">d.what.rast</A></EM> to
query individual cell values.<p>
