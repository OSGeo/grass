<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.db.reconnect.all</EM> changes database connection of all layers of
all vectors in the current mapset from old_database to database. If a link
does not match the old_database it is left untouched.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The value of the <em>old_database</em> option needs to be the exact
string which appears as the fourth field printed by
<code>'v.db.connect -g'</code>, i.e. with substituted variables.
