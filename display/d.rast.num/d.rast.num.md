## DESCRIPTION

*d.rast.num* overlays cell category values onto a raster map layer
displayed on the user's graphics monitor. Category values will be
displayed in the text color given and scaled to fit within a single
cell. A grid outlining each map cell will also be overlain in a
user-specified color, unless it has been set to "none".

If no grid color is given the default will be used. If no map layer is
specified, the program will use whatever raster map layer is currently
displayed in the active frame on the graphics monitor.

If the **-f** flag is given the displayed number will take on the color
of the base map in that cell.

## NOTES

The user is advised to set the current region to a relatively small area
(i.e., less than 100 rows by 100 columns); otherwise, the individual
cells being displayed will be small and the category value associated
with each will be difficult to see. No data cells are indicated with
"Null".

## EXAMPLE

Distance from the streams network (North Carolina sample dataset):

```sh
g.region raster=streams_derived -p
r.grow.distance input=streams_derived distance=dist_from_streams
d.rast.num dist_from_streams -a
```
