## DESCRIPTION

*d.barscale* displays a barscale on the graphics monitor at the given
screen coordinates. If no coordinates are given it will draw the
barscale in the bottom left of the display.

The barscale can drawn in a number of styles (see **style** parameter
for their previews).

## NOTE

*d.barscale* will not work with Lat/Lon coordinate reference system as
the horizontal scale distance changes with latitude. Try
*[d.grid](d.grid.md)* instead.

## SEE ALSO

*[d.graph](d.graph.md), [d.grid](d.grid.md), [d.legend](d.legend.md),
[d.northarrow](d.northarrow.md), [g.region](g.region.md)*
