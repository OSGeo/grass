<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.what.vect</em>
outputs the category value(s) associated with user-specified location(s) 
in user-specified vector map layer(s). 

<p>
The program activates the mouse, and expects the user to indicate the 
location(s) to be queried by depressing a mouse button over desired location(s) 
within the current geographic region in the active display frame on the 
graphic monitor. Query results from map(s) are by default displayed in a new 
monitor, where label values can be added or changed. Using parameter <b>-x</b> 
informations will be displayed as plain text to terminal window.
<p>
This module always reports standard acres, even when the location uses
US Survey feet as the map unit.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

A sample <em>d.what.vect</em> session is given below. Although it is not 
necessary that the user first displays a vector map to be queried in the 
active display frame, it is helpful to have a map displayed there for 
reference. 

<p>

<b>d.vect map=</b><em>roads</em><p>
Displays the <em>roads</em> vector map layer on the graphics monitor. 
<p>

<b>d.what.vect map=</b><em>roads,geology</em><p>
After typing this, the user moves the mouse to a desired location 
on the displayed <em>roads</em> map layer, and presses the left mouse 
button to query the category value of the <em>roads</em> and the
<em>geology</em> vector map at this location. 

The program then outputs the category value of a line type corresponding 
to this user-selected map location, for the vector map queried by the user. 

<p>

The query may be repeated as often as desired using the left mouse button. The 
middle mouse button toggles the flash color.
The right button on the mouse is used to quit the <em>d.what.vect</em> session.
