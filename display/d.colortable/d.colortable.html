<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.colortable</em> is used to display the color table associated
with a raster map in the active frame on the graphics
monitor. The <b>map</b> name should be an available raster map in the
user's current mapset search path and location.

<p>If the <em>values</em> of both <b>lines</b> and <b>columns</b> are
not specified by the user, <em>d.colortable</em> divides the active
frame equally among the number of categories present in the named
raster map. If one option is specified, the other is automatically set
to accommodate all categories.  If both are specified, as many
categories as possible are displayed.

<p>If the user specifies the name of a map on the command line but does not 
specify the values of other parameters, parameter default values will be used. 
Alternately, if the user types simply <em>d.colortable</em> on the command line 
without any program arguments, the program will prompt the user for parameter 
settings using the standard GRASS parser interface.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

The user running the command: 

<div class="code"><pre>
d.colortable map=soils color=red lines=1 columns=3
</pre></div>

would see the active graphics frame divided into three columns
extending the full frame height. The lines dividing the color table
associated with the <em>soils</em> map would be displayed in red. The
user would see, at most, only three of the colors from
the <em>soils</em> color table displayed in the active frame (because
the user requested that this frame be divided into three sections).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

If the user wishes to display the entire color table associated with 
a map, the user should either stipulate a number of lines (rows) and 
columns (cols) sufficient to accommodate the number of categories 
in the map's color table, or fail to assign values to one or both of 
<b>lines</b> and/or <b>columns</b>.
If the user runs <em>d.colortable</em> using the default number of 
lines and columns (the full graphics frame), all categories from the 
map's color table will be displayed. However, if the user requests 
that the color table associated with a map which has 10 data categories 
be displayed in a graphics frame with only 3 lines (rows) and 2 columns 
(a total of six cells), 
only six of the ten map categories will be displayed. 

<p>The user should run <em><a href="d.erase.html">d.erase</a></em>
between runs of <em>d.colortable</em> to avoid confusion.
