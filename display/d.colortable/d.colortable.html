<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The GRASS program <em>d.colortable</em> 
is used to display the color table associated with a raster map layer in the 
active frame on the graphics monitor. The <em>map</em> name should be 
an available raster map layer in the user's current mapset search path 
and location. 

<p>
If the <em>values</em> of both <em>lines</em> and <em>cols</em> are
not specified by the user, <em>d.colortable</em> 
divides the active frame equally among the number of categories 
present in the named raster map layer. If one option is specified, 
the other is automatically set to accommodate all categories. 
If both are specified, as many categories as possible are displayed. 

<p>
If the user specifies the name of a map on the command line but does not 
specify the values of other parameters, parameter default values will be used. 
Alternately, if the user types simply <em>d.colortable</em> on the command line 
without any program arguments, the program will prompt the user for parameter 
settings using the standard GRASS parser interface.


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

The user running the command: 
<DL>
<DD>
<B>d.colortable map=</B><em>soils</em> 
  <B>color=</B><em>red</em>
  <B>lines=</B><em>1</em>
  <B>cols=</B><em>3</em>
</DL>
would see the active graphics frame divided into three columns 
extending the full frame height. The lines dividing the color table 
associated with the <em>soils</em> map would be displayed in red. 
The user would see, at most, only three of the colors from the <em>soils</em> 
color table displayed in the active frame (because the user requested 
that this frame be divided into three sections).


<h2>NOTES</h2>

If the user wishes to display the entire color table associated with 
a map, the user should either stipulate a number of lines (rows) and 
columns (cols) sufficient to accommodate the number of categories 
in the map's color table, or fail to assign values to one or both of 
<em>lines</em> and/or <em>cols</em>.
If the user runs <em>d.colortable</em> using the default number of 
lines and columns (the full graphics frame), all categories from the 
map's color table will be displayed. However, if the user requests 
that the color table associated with a map which has 10 data categories 
be displayed in a graphics frame with only 3 lines (rows) and 2 columns 
(a total of six cells), 
only six of the ten map categories will be displayed. 

<p>
The user should run the GRASS program 
<em><a href="d.erase.html">d.erase</A></em> between 
runs of <em>d.colortable</em> to avoid confusion.
