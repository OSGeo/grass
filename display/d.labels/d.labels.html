<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.labels</em> displays a <em>paint</em> label file in the 
active display frame on the graphics monitor. Each label has components 
which determine the text, the location of the text on the image, its 
size, and the background for the text. This file can be generated with 
the <em><a href="v.label.html">v.label</a></em> program or simply created 
by the user as an ASCII file (using a text editor) and placed in the 
appropriate directory under the user's current mapset and location 
(i.e. <tt>$MAPSET/paint/labels/</tt>).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Some of the information stored in the label file is unused by 
<em>d.labels</em>.
<!-- The unused information found in a label file is printed to standard 
output. -->
This extra information is used by such programs as 
<em><a href="ps.map.html">ps.map</a></em>.

<p>This module was formerly known as <em>d.paint.labels</em>.
The the old version of <em>d.labels</em> from GRASS 5, which provided
interactive placement and modification of paint labels, still needs to 
have its functionality merged into this module.
