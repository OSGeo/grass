<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.labels</em> displays a <em>paint</em> label file in the
active display frame on the graphics monitor. Each label has components
which determine the text, the location of the text on the image, its
size, and the background for the text. This file can be generated with
the <em><a href="v.label.html">v.label</a></em> program or simply created
by the user as an ASCII file (using a text editor) and placed in the
appropriate directory under the user's current mapset and project
(i.e. <code>$MAPSET/paint/labels/</code>).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Some of the information stored in the label file is unused by
<em>d.labels</em>.
<!-- The unused information found in a label file is printed to standard
output. -->
This extra information is used by such programs as
<em><a href="ps.map.html">ps.map</a></em>.

<p>This module was formerly known as <em>d.paint.labels</em>.
The old version of <em>d.labels</em> from GRASS 5, which provided
interactive placement and modification of paint labels, still needs to
have its functionality merged into this module.
