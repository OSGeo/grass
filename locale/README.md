# Contributing to GRASS GIS Translations

**Welcome!** Thank you for your interest in helping translate GRASS GIS.
Your contributions make GRASS accessible to users around the world.

## For translators: How to contribute

**No programming or technical skills required!** All translation work is done through
a web-based interface at [Weblate](https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/grass-gis/).

### Quick start

1. **Create an account** at [OSGeo Weblate](https://weblate.osgeo.org/)
2. **Choose your language** at the [GRASS GIS project page](https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/grass-gis/)
3. **Start translating** directly in your browser - no software installation needed!

If your language isn't listed, you can request it to be added through the
Weblate interface. Weblate administrators will set it up for you.

### Need help?

- Ask questions on the [GRASS development forum](https://discourse.osgeo.org/c/grass/developer/61)
- Email the development mailing list at `grass-dev@lists.osgeo.org`
  ([subscribe here](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-dev))

Your time and effort are valuable - thank you for contributing!

## For developers: Technical notes

Translations from Weblate are automatically submitted to the GRASS source repository
as pull requests.

GRASS must be configured with `--with-nls` and recompiled to use translated messages.
Updating message catalogs requires a Unix-like system with `gettext` installed.
