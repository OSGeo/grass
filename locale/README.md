# Translation Technical Details

For instructions on how to contribute translations, please see the
[Translations section in CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#translations).

## Technical notes for developers

Translations from Weblate are automatically submitted to the GRASS source repository
as pull requests.

GRASS must be configured with `--with-nls` and recompiled to use translated messages.
Updating message catalogs requires a Unix-like system with `gettext` installed.
