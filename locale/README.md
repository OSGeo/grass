# HOWTO translate GRASS GIS messages

## Where to translate user message

Translators work in <https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/grass-gis/>.
Messages translated in Weblate then will be automatically submitted to the
GRASS GIS source repo as pull requests.

If you have any difficulties please ask for help
on the GRASS development mailing list `grass-dev lists.osgeo.org`
(subscribe at <https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-dev>). Your
willingness, time, and effort translating are valuable.

Note that GRASS must be configured with `--with-nls` and (re)compiled
to make use of the translated messages.

**Please help us translate all the GRASS messages!!**

## Notes

GRASS GIS translation portal: <https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/grass-gis/>

Updating the message catalogs currently only works on
unix-like systems and requires "gettext".
