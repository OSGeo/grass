HOWTO translate GRASS messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This file contains following sections:
1. A translation workflow overview;
2. A detailed explanation of translation workflow, testing;
3. Some notes and links

Updating the message catalogs currently only works on
unix-like systems and requires xgettext.

GENERAL TRANSLATION PROCEDURE (no programming required)

 POT files [1] ---->  PO files [2] ----> update PO files [3] ----> PO merge + MO files [4]
 (original           (translated            (updating of msgs      (final binary message file,
  messages)           messages)              in Transifex)          used by GRASS GIS modules)

 see also: https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_messages_translation#Get_the_translated_po_files

[1] .pot files are auto-generated on grass.osgeo.org and
    stored in https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-devel/binary/linux/snapshot/transifex/
     --> cronjob (run on grasslxd container): https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons/tree/grass8/utils/cronjobs_osgeo_lxd/

[2] Translators work in https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/grass-gis/

[4] Updated po files are taken from Weblate and submitted automatically into GRASS GIS source repo as pull requests

If you have any difficulty with these instructions please ask for help
on the GRASS development mailing list <grass-dev lists.osgeo.org>
(subscribe at https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-dev). Your
willingness, time, and effort translating are valuable. If necessary,
all of these steps except for the actual translation can be done by
someone else on a different computer.

Note that GRASS must be configured with '--with-nls' and (re)compiled
to make use of the translated messages.

There is a file for all library messages and another for all
module messages (this might be split in future).
