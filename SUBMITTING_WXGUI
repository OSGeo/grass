NOTE: Please improve this list!

Dear (new) GRASS developer,

when submitting Python code to GRASS SVN repository, please take
care of following rules:

[ see SUBMITTING for C hints ]
[ see SUBMITTING_PYTHON for Python code hints ]
[ see SUBMITTING_DOCS for documentation ]


0.  Introduction

    For general GRASS, svn and Python issues and module related issues see
    SUBMITTING_PYTHON and SUBMITTING.

    GUI is divided into components. One component is usually placed in one
    directory.


1.  GRASS documentation

    GRASS Programming manual for API and existing classes
    http://grass.osgeo.org/programming7/wxpythonlib.html

    GRASS wiki has pages about how to develop wxGUI
    http://grasswiki.osgeo.org

    GRASS Trac wiki has pages about the state of wxGUI development
    http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/wxGUIDevelopment


2.  External documentation

    Style Guide for Python Code
    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

    Python Style Guide by Guido van Rossum
    http://www.python.org/doc/essays/styleguide.html

    wxPython Style Guide
    http://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPython_Style_Guide

    Additional info on Python docstrings
    http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/docstrings.html


3.  Remember that functionality such as generating plots should be primarily
    provided by modules not GUI.


4.  Try to create create also g.gui.* module for the new GUI component. It helps
    advanced users to access functionality and developers to test it. Moreover,
    it helps to keep components separated and thus, supports re-usability.


5.  Add a header section to each file you submit and make sure you
    include the copyright. The purpose section is meant to contain a
    general over view of the code in the file to assist other
    programmers that will need to make changes to your code. For this
    purpose use Python docstring.

    The copyright protects your rights according to GNU General Public
    License (www.gnu.org).

    Please use the following docstring template:

    """!
    @package dir.example

    @brief Short example package description

    Classes:
     - example::ExampleClass

    (C) 2012 by the GRASS Development Team

    This program is free software under the GNU General Public License
    (>=v2). Read the file COPYING that comes with GRASS for details.

    @author First Author <first somewhere.com>
    @author Second Author <second somewhere.com>
    @author Some Other <third somewhere.com> (some particular change)
    """


6.  Comment your classes and functions with docstrings. Use Doxygen syntax,
    particularly, use commands which begins with @
    (www.doxygen.org/manual/commands.html).

    Comment also the code itself such as the meaning of variables,
    conditions etc.


7.  Make sure a new line is at the end of each file. Non empty line breaks the
    build process.


8.  Basic rules

    Do not use print command unless you know what are you doing.

    Use named parameters in functions (without space around '='), e.g.

    dlg = wx.FileDialog(parent=self, message=_("Choose file to save current workspace"),
                        wildcard=_("GRASS Workspace File (*.gxw)|*.gxw"), style=wx.FD_SAVE)

    instead of

    dlg = wx.FileDialog(self, _("Choose file to save current workspace"),
                        _("GRASS Workspace File (*.gxw)|*.gxw"), wx.FD_SAVE)

    Use wx.ID_ANY instead of `-1`.

    Use GError, GWarning and GMessage instead of wx.MessageBox()

    Do not use grass.run_command() or grass.read_command(). Use functions and
    classes which uses threads such as RunCommand.

    Use full strings, e.g.

      if ...:
          win.SetLabel(_('Name for new 3D raster map to create'))
      else:
          win.SetLabel(_('Name for new raster map to create'))

      instead of

      _('Name for new %s to create') % maplabel

      where `maplabel` can be 'raster map' or '3D raster map'

      When using AddGrowableCol/AddGrowableRow with sizers, put it after
      adding widgets into the sizer, not just after creating of the sizer
      (needed for wxPython >= 2.9).


9.  Use tools such as pylint and pep8 to check your code (both style and
    correctness). Just note that default settings of these tools is not fully
    compatible with wxGUI/wxPython style and that some of the reported errors
    may not apply to your code.


14. Tell the other developers about the new code using the following e-mail:
    grass-dev@lists.osgeo.org
 
    To subscribe to this mailing list, see
    http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-dev


15. In case of questions feel free to contact the other developers at the above
    mailing list.
