<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>t.rast.algebra</em> performs temporal and spatial map algebra operations on
space time raster datasets (STRDS) using the temporal raster algebra.

<h3>PROGRAM USE</h3>
The module expects an <b>expression</b> as input parameter in the 
following form:
<p>
<b>"result = expression"</b>
<p>
The statement structure is similar to that of <a href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a>.
In this statement, <b>result</b> represents the name of the space time 
raster dataset (STRDS) that will contain the result of the calculation
that is given as <b>expression</b> on the right side of the equality sign.
These expressions can be any valid or nested combination of temporal
operations and spatial overlay or buffer functions that are provided by
the temporal algebra.
<p>
The temporal raster algebra works only with space time raster datasets
(STRDS). The algebra provides methods for map selection based on their
temporal relations. It is also possible to temporally shift maps, to
create temporal buffer and to snap time instances to create a valid
temporal topology. Furthermore, expressions can be nested and evaluated
in conditional statements (if, else statements). Within if-statements,
the algebra provides temporal variables like start time, end time, day
of year, time differences or number of maps per time interval to build
up conditions.
<br>
In addition the algebra provides a subset of the spatial operations
from <a href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a>. All these operations can be
assigned to STRDS or to the map lists resulting of operations between 
STRDS.
<p>
By default, only temporal topological relations among space time datasets
(STDS) are evaluated. The <b>-s</b> flag can be used to additionally
activate the evaluation of the spatial topology based on the spatial
extent of maps.
<p>
The expression option must be passed as <b>quoted</b> expression, for
example:

<div class="code"><pre>
t.rast.algebra expression="C = A + B" basename=result
</pre></div>

Where <b>C</b> is the new space time raster dataset that will contain
maps with the basename "result" and a numerical suffix separated by an
underscore that represent the sum of maps from the STRDS
<b>A</b> and temporally equal maps (i.e., maps with equal temporal
topology relation) from the STRDS <b>B</b>.

<p>
The map <b>basename</b> for the result STRDS must always be specified.

<h2>TEMPORAL RASTER ALGEBRA</h2>

The temporal algebra provides a wide range of temporal operators and
functions that will be presented in the following section.

<h3>TEMPORAL RELATIONS</h3>

Several temporal topology relations are supported between maps registered
in space time datasets:

<div class="code"><pre>
equals            A ------
                  B ------

during            A  ----
                  B ------

contains          A ------
                  B  ----

starts            A ----
                  B ------

started           A ------
                  B ----

finishs           A   ----
                  B ------

finished          A ------
                  B   ----

precedes          A ----
                  B     ----

follows           A     ----
                  B ----

overlapped        A   ------
                  B ------

overlaps          A ------
                  B   ------

over              both overlaps and overlapped
</pre></div>

<!- TODO: fix formatting of next sentence to become readable! ->
The relations must be read as: A is related to B, like - A equals B - A
is during B - A contains B.
<p>
Topological relations must be specified with curly brackets {}.

<h3>TEMPORAL OPERATORS</h3>

The temporal algebra defines temporal operators that can be combined with
other operators to perform spatio-temporal operations. 
The temporal operators process the time instances and intervals of two
temporally related maps and calculate the resulting temporal extent in
five possible different ways.

<div class="code"><pre>
LEFT REFERENCE     l       Use the time stamp of the left space time dataset
INTERSECTION       i       Intersection
DISJOINT UNION     d       Disjoint union
UNION              u       Union
RIGHT REFERENCE    r       Use the time stamp of the right space time dataset
</pre></div>

<h3>TEMPORAL SELECTION</h3>

The temporal selection simply selects parts of a space time dataset without
processing any raster or vector data. The algebra provides a selection
operator <b>:</b> that by default selects parts of a space time dataset
that are temporally equal to parts of a second space time dataset. The
following expression

<div class="code"><pre>
C = A : B
</pre></div>

means: select all parts of space time dataset A that are equal to B and
store them in space time dataset C. These parts are time stamped maps.
<p>
In addition, the inverse selection operator <b>!:</b> is defined as the
complement of the selection operator, hence the following expression

<div class="code"><pre>
C = A !: B
</pre></div>

means: select all parts of space time time dataset A that are not equal
to B and store them in space time dataset C.
<p>
To select parts of a STRDS using different topological relations
regarding to other STRDS, the temporal topology selection operator
can be used. This operator consists of the temporal selection operator,
the topological relations that must be separated by the logical OR
operator <b>|</b> and, the temporal extent operator. All three parts 
are separated by comma and surrounded by curly brackets as follows:
{"temporal selection operator", "topological relations", "temporal operator"}.
<p>

<b>Examples:</b>

<div class="code"><pre>
C = A {:,equals} B
C = A {!:,equals} B
</pre></div>

We can now define arbitrary topological relations using the OR operator "|"
to connect them:

<div class="code"><pre>
C = A {:,equals|during|overlaps} B
</pre></div>

Select all parts of A that are equal to B, during B or overlaps B.<br>

In addition, we can define the temporal extent of the resulting STRDS by
adding the temporal operator.

<div class="code"><pre>
C = A {:,during,r} B
</pre></div>

Select all parts of A that are during B and use the temporal extents
from B for C.<br><br>
The selection operator is implicitly contained in the temporal topology
selection operator, so that the following statements are exactly the same:

<div class="code"><pre>
C = A : B
C = A {:} B
C = A {:,equal} B
C = A {:,equal,l} B
</pre></div>

Same for the complementary selection:

<div class="code"><pre>
C = A !: B
C = A {!:} B
C = A {!:,equal} B
C = A {!:,equal,l} B
</pre></div>

<h3>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</h3>

Selection operations can be evaluated within conditional statements as
showed below. Note that A and B can be either space time datasets or 
expressions. The temporal relationship between the conditions and the
conclusions can be defined at the beginning of the if statement (third
and fourth examples below). The relationship between then and else 
conclusion must be always equal.

<div class="code"><pre>
if statement                        decision option                        temporal relations
  if(if, then, else)
  if(conditions, A)                   A if conditions are True;              temporal topological relation between if and then is equal.
  if(conditions, A, B)                A if conditions are True, B otherwise; temporal topological relation between if, then and else is equal.
  if(topologies, conditions, A)       A if conditions are True;              temporal topological relation between if and then is explicitly specified by topologies.
  if(topologies, conditions, A, B)    A if conditions are True, B otherwise; temporal topological relation between if, then and else is explicitly specified by topologies.
</pre></div>

The conditions are comparison expressions that are used to evaluate
space time datasets. Specific values of temporal variables are
compared by logical operators and evaluated for each map of the STRDS.
<br>
<b>Important:</b> The conditions are evaluated from left to right. 

<h4>Logical operators</h4>

<div class="code"><pre>
Symbol  description

  ==    equal
  !=    not equal
  >     greater than
  >=    greater than or equal
  <     less than
  <=    less than or equal
  &&    and
  ||    or
</pre></div>

<h4>Temporal functions</h4>

The following temporal functions are evaluated only for the STDS that
must be given in parenthesis.

<div class="code"><pre>
td(A)                    Returns a list of time intervals of STDS A

start_time(A)            Start time as HH::MM:SS
start_date(A)            Start date as yyyy-mm-DD
start_datetime(A)        Start datetime as yyyy-mm-DD HH:MM:SS
end_time(A)              End time as HH:MM:SS
end_date(A)              End date as yyyy-mm-DD
end_datetime(A)          End datetime as  yyyy-mm-DD HH:MM

start_doy(A)             Day of year (doy) from the start time [1 - 366]
start_dow(A)             Day of week (dow) from the start time [1 - 7], the start of the week is Monday == 1
start_year(A)            The year of the start time [0 - 9999]
start_month(A)           The month of the start time [1 - 12]
start_week(A)            Week of year of the start time [1 - 54]
start_day(A)             Day of month from the start time [1 - 31]
start_hour(A)            The hour of the start time [0 - 23]
start_minute(A)          The minute of the start time [0 - 59]
start_second(A)          The second of the start time [0 - 59]
end_doy(A)               Day of year (doy) from the end time [1 - 366]
end_dow(A)               Day of week (dow) from the end time [1 - 7], the start of the week is Monday == 1
end_year(A)              The year of the end time [0 - 9999]
end_month(A)             The month of the end time [1 - 12]
end_week(A)              Week of year of the end time [1 - 54]
end_day(A)               Day of month from the start time [1 - 31]
end_hour(A)              The hour of the end time [0 - 23]
end_minute(A)            The minute of the end time [0 - 59]
end_second(A)            The second of the end time [0 - 59]
</pre></div>

<h4>Comparison operator</h4>

As mentioned above, the conditions are comparison expressions that are
used to evaluate space time datasets. Specific values of temporal 
variables are compared by logical operators and evaluated for each map
of the STDS and (optionally) related maps.
For complex relations, the comparison operator can be used to combine
conditions. 
<br>
The structure is similar to the select operator with the addition of an
aggregation operator: 
{"comparison operator", "topological relations", aggregation operator, "temporal operator"}
<br>
This aggregation operator (| or &) defines the behaviour when a map is
related to more than one map, e.g. for the topological relation 'contains'.
Should all (&) conditions for the related maps be true or is it sufficient
to have any (|) condition that is true. The resulting boolean value is
then compared to the first condition by the comparison operator (|| or &&).
By default, the aggregation operator is related to the comparison
operator:<br>
comparison operator -> aggregation operator:

<div class="code"><pre>
|| -> | and && -> & 
</pre></div>

<b>Examples:</b>
<div class="code"><pre>
Condition 1 {||, equal, r} Condition 2
Condition 1 {&&, equal|during, l} Condition 2
Condition 1 {&&, equal|contains, |, l} Condition 2
Condition 1 {&&, equal|during, l} Condition 2 && Condition 3
Condition 1 {&&, equal|during, l} Condition 2 {&&,contains, |, r} Condition 3
</pre></div>

<h4>Hash operator</h4>

Additionally, the number of maps in intervals can be computed and used in 
conditional statements with the hash (#) operator.

<div class="code"><pre>
A {#, contains} B
</pre></div>

This expression computes the number of maps from space time dataset B
which are during the time intervals of maps from space time dataset A.<br>
A list of integers (scalars) corresponding to the maps of A that contain
maps from B will be returned.

<div class="code"><pre>
C = if({equal}, A {#, contains} B > 2, A {:, contains} B)
</pre></div>

This expression selects all maps from A that temporally contain at least 2 
maps from B and stores them in space time dataset C. The leading equal
statement in the if condition specifies the temporal relation between
the if and then part of the if expression. This is very important, so we
do not need to specify a global time reference (a space time dataset)
for temporal processing.
<p>
Furthermore, the temporal algebra allows temporal buffering, shifting
and snapping with the functions buff_t(), tshift() and tsnap(),
respectively.

<div class="code"><pre>
buff_t(A, size)         Buffer STDS A with granule ("1 month" or 5)
tshift(A, size)         Shift STDS A with granule ("1 month" or 5)
tsnap(A)                Snap time instances and intervals of STDS A
</pre></div>

<h4>Single map with temporal extent</h4>

The temporal algebra can also handle single maps with time stamps in the
tmap() function.

<div class="code"><pre>
tmap()
</pre></div>

For example:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A {:, during} tmap(event)
</pre></div>

This statement selects all maps from space time data set A that are during 
the temporal extent of the single map 'event'

<h3>Spatial raster operators</h3>

The module supports the following raster operations: 

<div class="code"><pre>
Symbol  description     precedence

  %     modulus         1
  /     division        1
  *     multiplication  1
  +     addition        2
  -     subtraction     2
</pre></div>

And raster functions:
<div class="code"><pre>
abs(x)                  return absolute value of x
float(x)                convert x to foating point
int(x)                  convert x to integer [ truncates ]
log(x)                  natural log of x
sqrt(x)                 square root of x
tan(x)                  tangent of x (x is in degrees)
round(x)                round x to nearest integer
sin(x)                  sine of x (x is in degrees)
isnull(x)               check if x = NULL
isntnull(x)             check if x is not NULL
null                    set null value
exist(x)                Check if x is in the current mapset                 
</pre></div>

<h4>Single raster map </h4>

The temporal raster algebra features also a function to integrate single
raster maps without time stamps into the expressions.

<div class="code"><pre>
map()
</pre></div>

For example:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A * map(constant_value)
</pre></div>

This statement multiplies all raster maps from space time raster data
set A with the raster map 'constant_value'

<h3>Combinations of temporal, raster and select operators</h3>

The user can combine the temporal topology relations, the temporal
operators and the spatial/select operators to create spatio-temporal
operators as follows:

<div class="code"><pre>
{"spatial or select operator", "list of temporal relations", "temporal operator"}
</pre></div>

For multiple topological relations or several related maps the spatio-temporal 
operators feature implicit aggregation.

The algebra evaluates the stated STDS by their temporal topologies and apply 
the given spatio-temporal operators in a aggregated form.

If we have two STDS A and B, B has three maps: b1, b2, b3 that are all during 
the temporal extent of the single map a1 of A, then the following arithmetic 
calculations would implicitly aggregate all maps of B into one result map for 
a1 of A:

<pre class="code">
 C = A {+, contains} B --> c1 = a1 + b1 + b2 + b3
</pre><p>

<b>Important</b>: the aggregation behaviour is not symmetric

<pre class="code">
 C = B {+, during} A --> c1 = b1 + a1
                         c2 = b2 + a1
                         c3 = b3 + a1
</pre>

<h3>Temporal neighbourhood modifier</h3>

The neighbourhood modifier of <em>r.mapcalc</em> is extended for the temporal 
raster algebra with the temporal dimension. The format is strds[t,r,c], 
where t is the temporal offset, r is the row offset and c is the column 
offset.

<pre class="code">
strds[2] 
</pre>
refers to the second successor of the current map.
<p>

<pre class="code">
strds[1,2]
</pre>
refers to the cell one row below and two columns to the right of the current
cell in the current map.
<p>

<pre class="code">
strds[1,-2,-1] 
</pre>
refers to the cell two rows above and one column to the left of the current
cell of the first successor map.
<p>

<pre class="code">
strds[-2,0,1]
</pre>
refers to the cell one column to the right of the current cell in the
second predecessor map.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Computation of NDVI</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
# Sentinel-2 bands are stored separately in two STDRS "S2_b4" and "S2_b8"
g.region raster=sentinel2_B04_10m -p
t.rast.list S2_b4
t.rast.list S2_b8
t.rast.algebra basename=ndvi expression="ndvi = float(S2_b8 - S2_b4) / ( S2_b8 + S2_b4 )" 
t.rast.colors input=ndvi color=ndvi
</pre></div>

<h3>Sum of space-time raster datasets</h3>

Sum maps from STRDS A with maps from STRDS B which have equal time stamps
and are temporally before Jan. 1. 2005 and store them in STRDS D:
<div class="code"><pre>
D = if(start_date(A) < "2005-01-01", A + B)
</pre></div>

Create the sum of all maps from STRDS A and B that have equal time stamps
and store the new maps in STRDS C:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A + B
</pre></div>

<h3>Sum of space-time raster datasets with temporal topology relation</h3>

Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation
and temporal operators:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A {+,equal,l} B
</pre></div>

<h3>Selection of raster cells</h3>

Select all cells from STRDS B with equal temporal relations to STRDS A, if
the cells of A are in the range [100.0, 1600] of time intervals that have
more than 30 days (Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Aug, Oct, Dec):
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if(A > 100 && A < 1600 && td(A) > 30, B)
</pre></div>

<h3>Selection of raster cells with temporal topology relation</h3>

Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation
and temporal operators:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if({equal}, A > 100 && A < 1600 {&&,equal} td(A) > 30, B)
</pre></div>

<h3>Conditional computation</h3>

Compute the recharge in meters per second for all cells of precipitation
STRDS "Prec" if the mean temperature specified in STRDS "Temp" is higher
than 10 degrees. Computation is performed if STRDS "Prec" and "Temp" have
equal time stamps. The number of days or fraction of days per interval is
computed using the td() function that has as argument the STRDS "Prec":
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if(Temp > 10.0, Prec / 3600.0 / 24.0 / td(Prec))
</pre></div>

<h3>Conditional computation with temporal topology relation</h3>

Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation
and temporal operators:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if({equal}, Temp > 10.0, Prec / 3600.0 / 24.0 {/,equal,l} td(Prec))
</pre></div>

<h3>Computation with time intervals</h3>
Compute the mean value of all maps from STRDS A that are located during time
intervals of STRDS B if more than one map of A is contained in an interval
of B, use A otherwise. The resulting time intervals are either from B or A:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if(B {#,contain} A > 1, (B {+,contain,l} A - B) / (B {#,contain} A), A)
</pre></div>

<h3>Computation with time intervals with temporal topology relation</h3>

Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation
and temporal operators:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if({equal}, B {#,contain} A > 1, (B {+,contain,l} A {-,equal,l} B) {equal,=/} (B {#,contain} A), A)
</pre></div>
