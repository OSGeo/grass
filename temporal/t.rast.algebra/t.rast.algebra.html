<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

t.rast.algebra performs temporal and spatial map algebra operations on space time raster datasets (STRDS)
by using the temporal raster algebra.

<h3>PROGRAM USE</h3>
The module expects an <b>expression</b> as input parameter in the following form: <p>
<b> "result = expression" </b>
<p>

The statement structure is similar to r.mapcalc, see <a href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a>.
Where <b>result</b> represents the name of a space time raster dataset (STRDS)that will
contain the result of the calculation that is given as <b>expression</b>
on the right side of the equality sign.
These expression can be any valid or nested combination of temporal
operations and spatial overlay or buffer functions that are provided by the temporal algebra.  <br>
The temporal raster algebra works with space time raster datasets only (STRDS).
The algebra provides methods for map selection from STRDS based on their temporal relations.
It is also possible to temporally shift maps, to create temporal buffer and to snap time
instances to create a valid temporal topology. Furthermore expressions can be nested and
evaluated in conditional statements (if, else statements). Within if-statements the algebra
provides temporal variables like start time, end time, day of year, time differences or
number of maps per time interval to build up conditions.
<br>
In addition the algebra provides
a subset of the spatial operations from <a href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a>.
All these operations can be assigned to STRDS or to the resulting map lists of operations between STRDS.
<p>
As default, topological relationships between space time datasets will be
evaluated only temporal. Use the <b>s</b> flag to activate the
additionally evaluate the spatial topology based on the spatial extents of maps.
<p>
The expression option must be passed as <b>quoted</b>
expression, for example: <br>
<div class="code"><pre>t.rast.mapcalc2 expression="C = A + B" basename=result</pre></div>
Where <b>C</b> is the new space time raster dataset that will contain maps
with the basename "result" that represent the sum of maps from STRDS <b>A</b> and
equally temporal related maps from STRDS <b>B</b>.
<p>
The map basename for the result STRDS must always be specified.

<h2>TEMPORAL RASTER ALGEBRA</h2>


The temporal algebra provides a wide range of temporal operators and
functions that will be presented in the following section. <p>

<h3>TEMPORAL RELATIONS</h3>

Several temporal topology relations between registered maps of space
time datasets are supported: <br>
<div class="code"><pre>
equals            A ------
                  B ------

during            A  ----
                  B ------

contains          A ------
                  B  ----

starts            A ----
                  B ------

started           A ------
                  B ----

finishs           A   ----
                  B ------

finished          A ------
                  B   ----

precedes          A ----
                  B     ----

follows           A     ----
                  B ----

overlapped        A   ------
                  B ------

overlaps          A ------
                  B   ------

over              booth overlaps and overlapped

</pre></div>
The relations must be read as: A is related to B, like - A equals B - A is
during B - A contains B <p>
Topological relations must be specified in {} parentheses. <br>

<h3>TEMPORAL OPERATORS</h3>

The temporal algebra defines temporal operators that can be combined with other 
operators to perform spatio-temporal operations. 
The temporal operators process the time instances and intervals of two temporal 
related maps and calculate the result temporal extent by five differnt possibilities.
<div class="code"><pre>
LEFT REFERENCE     l       Use the time stamp of the left space time dataset
INTERSECTION       i       Intersection
DISJOINT UNION     d       Disjoint union
UNION              u       Union
RIGHT REFERENCE    r       Use the time stamp of the right space time dataset
</pre></div>


<h3>TEMPORAL SELECTION</h3>

The temporal selection simply selects parts of a space time dataset without
processing raster or vector data.

The algebra provides a selection operator <b>:</b> that selects parts
of a space time dataset that are temporally equal to parts of a second one
by default. The following expression
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A : B
</pre></div>
means: Select all parts of space time dataset A that are equal to B and store
it in space time dataset C. The parts are time stamped maps. <p>
In addition the inverse selection operator <b>!:</b> is defined as the complement of
the selection operator, hence the following expression
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A !: B
</pre></div>
means: select all parts of space time time dataset A that are not equal to B
and store it in space time dataset (STDS) C. <p>
To select parts of a STDS by different topological relations to other STDS,
the temporal topology selection operator can be used. The operator consists of
the temporal selection operator, the topological relations, that must be separated 
by the logical OR operator <b>|</b> and the temporal extent operator. 
All three parts are separated by comma and surrounded by curly braces:
{"temporal selection operator", "topological relations", "temporal operator"}  <p>

Examples:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A {:, equals} B
C = A {!:, equals} B
</pre></div>
We can now define arbitrary topological relations using the OR operator "|"
to connect them:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A {:,equals|during|overlaps} B
</pre></div>
Select all parts of A that are equal to B, during B or overlaps B. <br>

In addition we can define the temporal extent of the result STDS by adding the
temporal operator.
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A {:, during,r} B
</pre></div>
Select all parts of A that are during B and use the temporal extents from B for 
C. <br>

<br>
The selection operator is implicitly contained in the temporal topology
selection operator, so that the following statements are exactly the same:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A : B
C = A {:} B
C = A {:,equal} B
C = A {:,equal,l} B
</pre></div>

Same for the complementary selection:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A !: B
C = A {!:} B
C = A {!:,equal} B
C = A {!:,equal,l} B
</pre></div>

<h3>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</h3>

Selection operations can be evaluated within conditional statements.
<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
Note A and B can either be space time datasets or expressions. The temporal 
relationship between the conditions and the conclusions can be defined at the 
beginning of the if statement. The relationship between then and else conclusion 
must be always equal.

if statement                         decision option                        temporal relations
  if(if, then, else)
  if(conditions, A)                    A if conditions are True;              temporal topological relation between if and then is equal.
  if(conditions, A, B)                 A if conditions are True, B otherwise; temporal topological relation between if, then and else is equal.
  if(topologies, conditions, A)        A if conditions are True;              temporal topological relation between if and then is explicit specified by topologies.
  if(topologies, conditions, A, B)     A if conditions are True, B otherwise; temporal topological relation between if, then and else is explicit specified by topologies.
</pre></div>
The conditions are comparison expressions that are used to evaluate
space time datasets. Specific values of temporal variables are
compared by logical operators and evaluated for each map of the STDS.<br>
<b>Important:</b> The conditions are evaluated from left to right. 

<h4>Logical operators</h4>
<div class="code"><pre>

  >     greater than
  >=    greater than or equal
  <     less than

  ||    or
</pre></div>

<h4>Temporal functions</h4>

<div class="code"><pre>

</pre></div>

<h4>Comparison operator</h4>
The conditions are comparison expressions that are used to evaluate
space time datasets. Specific values of temporal variables are
compared by logical operators and evaluated for each map of the STDS and 
the related maps.
For complex relations the comparison operator can be used to combine conditions: 
<br>
The structure is similar to the select operator with the extention of an aggregation operator: 
{"comparison operator", "topological relations", aggregation operator, "temporal operator"}
<br>
This aggregation operator (| or &) define the behaviour if a map is related the more 
than one map, e.g for the topological relations 'contains'.
Should all (&) conditions for the related maps be true or is it sufficient to 
have any (|) condition that is true. The resulting boolean value is then compared 
to the first condition by the comparison operator (|| or &&). 
As default the aggregation operator is related to the comparison operator: <br>
Comparison operator -> aggregation operator:
<div class="code"><pre>
|| -> | and && -> & 
</pre></div>
Examples:
<div class="code"><pre>
Condition 1 {||, equal, r} Condition 2
Condition 1 {&&, equal|during, l} Condition 2
Condition 1 {&&, equal|contains, |, l} Condition 2
Condition 1 {&&, equal|during, l} Condition 2 && Condition 3
Condition 1 {&&, equal|during, l} Condition 2 {&&,contains, |, r} Condition 3
</pre></div>

<h4>Hash operator</h4>
Additionally the number of maps in intervals can be computed and used in 
conditional statements with the hash (#) operator. <br>
<div class="code"><pre>
A{#, contains}B
</pre></div>
This expression computes the number of maps from space
time dataset B which are during the time intervals of maps from
space time dataset A.<br>
A list of integers (scalars) corresponding to the maps of A
that contain maps from B will be returned. <p>
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if({equal}, A {#, contains} B > 2, A {:, contains} B)
</pre></div>
This expression selects all maps from A that temporally contains at least 2 
maps from B and stores them in space time dataset C. The leading equal statement 
in the if condition specifies the temporal relation between the if and then part 
of the if expression. This is very important, so we do not need to specify a 
global time reference (a space time dataset) for temporal processing.
<p>
Furthermore the temporal algebra allows temporal buffering, shifting
and snapping with the functions buff_t(), tshift() and tsnap()
respectively.
<div class="code"><pre>
buff_t(A, size)         Buffer STDS A with granule ("1 month" or 5)
tshift(A, size)         Shift STDS A with granule ("1 month" or 5)
tsnap(A)                Snap time instances and intervals of STDS A
</pre></div>
<br>
<h4>Single map with temporal extent</h4>
The temporal algebra can also handle single maps with time stamps in the
tmap function.
<div class="code"><pre>
tmap()
</pre></div>
For example:
<div class="code"><pre>
 C = A {:,during} tmap(event)
</pre></div>
This statement select all maps from space time data set A that are during 
the temporal extent of single map 'event'

<h3>Spatial raster operators</h3>

The module supports the following raster operations: <br>
<div class="code"><pre>
Symbol  description     precedence

  %     modulus         1
  /     division        1
  *     multiplication  1
  +     addition        2
  -     subtraction     2
</pre></div>

And raster functions:
<div class="code"><pre>
abs(x)                  return absolute value of x
float(x)                convert x to foating point
int(x)                  convert x to integer [ truncates ]
log(x)                  natural log of x
sqrt(x)                 square root of x
tan(x)                  tangent of x (x is in degrees)
round(x)		            round x to nearest integer
sin(x)			            sine of x (x is in degrees)
sqrt(x)			            square root of x
tan(x)			            tangent of x (x is in degrees)
isnull(x)               check if x = NULL
isntnull(x)             check if x is not NULL
null                    set null value
exist(x)                Check if x is in the current mapset                 
</pre></div>

<h4>Single raster map </h4>

The temporal raster algebra feature also a function to integrate single raster 
maps without time stamps into the expressions.
<div class="code"><pre>
 map()
</pre></div>
For example:
<div class="code"><pre>
 C = A * map(constant_value)
</pre></div>
This statement multiply all raster maps from space time raster data set A
with the raster map 'constant_value'
<h3>Combinations of temporal, raster and select operators</h3>

We combine the temporal topology relations, the temporal operators and the
spatial/select operators to create spatio-temporal operators:

<div class="code"><pre>
{"spatial or select operator", "list of temporal relations", "temporal operator"}
</pre></div>

For multiple topological relations or several related maps the spatio-temporal 
operators feature implicit aggregation.

The algebra evaluates the stated STDS by their temporal topologies and apply 
the given spatio temporal operators in a aggregated form.

If we have two STDS A and B, B has three maps: b1, b2, b3 that are all during 
the temporal extent of the single map a1 of A, then the following arithmetic 
calculations would implicitly aggregate all maps of B into one result map for 
a1 of A:
<pre class="code">
 C = A {+, contains} B --> c1 = a1 + b1 + b2 + b3
</pre><p>
Keep attention that the aggregation behaviour is not symmetric:
<pre class="code">
 C = B {+, during} A --> c1 = b1 + a1
                         c2 = b2 + a1
                         c3 = b3 + a1
</pre>
<h3>Temporal neighbourhood modifier</h3>

The neighbourhood modifier of r.mapcalc is extended for the temporal 
raster algebra by the temporal dimension. The format is strds[t,r,c], 
where t is the temporal offset, r is the row offset and c is the column 
offset. <br>

<pre class="code">
strds[2] 
</pre>
Refers to the second successor of the current map
<pre class="code">
strds[1,2]
</pre>
Refers to the cell one row below and two columns to the right of the current
cell in the current map
<pre class="code">
strds[1,-2,-1] 
</pre>
Refers to the cell two rows above and one column to the left of the current
cell of the first successor map
<pre class="code">
strds[-2,0,1]
</pre>
Refers to the cell one column to the right of the current cell in the
second predecessor map.

<h3>Examples: </h3>
Sum maps from space time dataset A with maps from space time dataset
B which have equal time stamps and are temporary before Jan. 1. 2005 and
store them in space time dataset D.
<div class="code"><pre>
D = if(start_date(A) < "2005-01-01", A + B)
</pre></div>

Create the sum of all maps from STRDS A and B that have equal time stamps
and store the new maps in STRDS C:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A + B
</pre></div>
Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation
and temporal operators:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A {+,equal,l} B
</pre></div>
Select all cells from STRDS B with equal temporal relations to STRDS A, if the 
cells of A are in the range of [100.0, 1600] of time intervals that have more 
then 30 days (Jan, Mar, Mai, Jul, Aug, Oct, Dec):
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if(A > 100 && A < 1600 && td(A) > 30, B)
</pre></div>
Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation
and temporal operators:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if({equal}, A > 100 && A < 1600 {&&,equal} td(A) > 30, B)
</pre></div>
Compute the recharge in meter per second for all cells of precipitation
STRDS "Prec" if the mean temperature specified in STRDS "Temp" is higher
than 10 degrees. Computation is performed if STRDS "Prec" and "Temp" have
equal time stamps. The number of days or fraction of days per interval is
computed using the td() function that has as argument the STRDS "Prec":
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if(Temp > 10.0, Prec / 3600.0 /24.0 / td(Prec))
</pre></div>
Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation
and temporal operators:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if({equal}, Temp > 10.0, Prec / 3600.0 / 24.0 {/,equal,l} td(Prec))
</pre></div>
Compute the mean value of all maps from STRDS A that are located during time
intervals of STRDS B if more than one map of A is contained in an interval
of B, use A otherwise, the resulting time intervals are either from B or A:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if(B {#,contain} A > 1, (B {+,contain,l} A - B) / (B {#,contain} A), A)
</pre></div>
Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation
and temporal operators:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = if({equal}, B {#,contain} A > 1, (B {+,contain,l} A {-,equal,l} B) {equal,=/} (B {#,contain} A), A)
</pre></div>
