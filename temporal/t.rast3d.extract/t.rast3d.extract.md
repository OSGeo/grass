## DESCRIPTION

*t.rast3d.extract* is used to extract a subset of a space time 3D raster
dataset and to store that subset in a different space time 3D raster
dataset. It has exactly the same functionality as
[t.rast.extract](t.rast.extract.md). The only difference is the that
this module works on STR3DS and 3D raster maps.

Please refer to [t.rast.extract](t.rast.extract.md) for documentation
and examples.
