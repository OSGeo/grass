<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2> 

<em>t.vect.mapcalc</em> performs temporal and spatial overlays and buffer 
functions on space time vector datasets (STVDS) by using the temporal 
vector algebra. New STVDS can be created, which are expressions of 
existing STVDS.

<h3>NOTES</h3> 
The module expects an <b>expression</b> as input parameter in the following form: <br>
<br>
<b> "result = expression" </b>
<br>
<br>

The statement structure is similar to r.mapcalc, see <a 
href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a>. Where <b>result</b> represents the 
name of a space time vector dataset (STVDS)that will contain the result 
of the calculation that is given as <b>expression</b> on the right side 
of the equality sign. These expression can be any valid or nested 
combination of temporal operations and spatial overlay or buffer 
functions that are provided by the temporal algebra.
<br>
The temporal vector algebra works with space time vector datasets only 
(STVDS). The algebra provides methods for map selection from STVDS 
based on their temporal relations. It is also possible to temporally 
shift maps, to create temporal buffer and to snap time instances to 
create a valid temporal topology. Furthermore expressions can be nested 
and evaluated in conditional statements (if, else statements). Within 
if-statements the algebra provides temporal variables like start time, 
end time, day of year, time differences or number of maps per time 
interval to build up conditions. In addition the algebra provides the 
spatial operations for vector overlay and buffering. All these 
operations can be assigned to STVDS or to the resulting map lists of 
operations between STVDS. 
<br>
<br>
As default, topological relationships between space time datasets will be 
evaluated only temporal. Use the <b>s</b> flag to activate the 
additionally evaluate the spatial topology based on the spatial extents of maps.
<br>
<br>
The expression option must be passed as <b>quoted</b> 
expression, for example: <br>
<div class="code"><pre>t.vect.mapcalc expression="C = A & B" basename=result</pre></div> 
Where <b>C</b> is the new space time vector dataset that will contain maps
with the basename "result" that represent the intersection of maps from STVDS <b>A</b> and 
equally temporal related maps from STVDS <b>B</b>.
<br>
<br>
The map basename for the result STVDS must always be specified.

<h2>Temporal vector algebra</h2>

The temporal vector algebra provides a wide range of temporal and spatial operators and 
functions that will be presented in the following section. <br>
<br>

<h3>Temporal relations</h3>

Several temporal topology relations between space 
time datasets are supported: <br>
<div class="code"><pre>
equals            A ------
                  B ------

during            A  ---- 
                  B ------

contains          A ------
                  B  ---- 

starts            A ----
                  B ------

started           A ------
                  B ----

finishs           A   ---- 
                  B ------

finished          A ------
                  B   ----

precedes          A ----
                  B     ----

follows           A     ----
                  B ----

overlapped        A   ------
                  B ------

overlaps          A ------
                  B   ------

over              booth overlaps and overlapped

</pre></div>
The relations must be read as: A is related to B, like - A equals B - A is 
during B - A contains B <br>
<br>
Topological relations must be specified in {} parentheses. <br>

<h3>Temporal Selection</h3>

The temporal selection simply selects parts of a space time dataset without 
processing raster or vector data.

The algebra provides a selection operator <b>:</b> that selects parts 
of a space time dataset that are temporally equal to parts of a second one 
by default. The following expression
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A : B
</pre></div>
means: Select all parts of space time dataset A that are equal to B and store 
it in space time dataset C. The parts are time stamped maps. <br>
<br>
In addition the inverse selection operator <b>!:</b> is defined as the complement of 
the selection operator, hence the following expression
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A !: B
</pre></div>
means: select all parts of space time time dataset A that are not equal to B 
and store it in space time dataset (STDS) C. <br>
<br>
To select parts of a STDS by different topological relations to other STDS, 
the temporal topology selection operator can be used. The operator consists of 
topological relations, that must be separated by the logical OR operator 
<b>|</b> and the temporal selection operator. Both parts are separated by 
comma and surrounded by curly braces: 
{"topological relations", "temporal selection operator"}  <br>
<br>
Examples:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A {equals,:} B
C = A {equals,!:} B
</pre></div>
We can now define arbitrary topological relations using logical OR operator 
to connect them:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A {equals|during|overlaps,:} B
</pre></div>
Select all parts of A that are equal to B, during B or overlaps B. <br>
<br>
The selection operator is implicitly contained in the temporal topology 
selection operator, so that the following statements are exactly the same:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A : B
C = A {:} B
C = A {equal,:} B
</pre></div>

Same for the complementary selection:
<div class="code"><pre>
C = A !: B
C = A {!:} B
C = A {equal,!:} B
</pre></div>

<h3>Conditional statements</h3>

Selection operations can be evaluated within conditional statements.
<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
Note A and B can either be space time datasets or expressions.

if statement                         decision option                        temporal relations
  if(if, then, else)
  if(conditions, A)                    A if conditions are True;              temporal topological relation between if and then is equal.
  if(conditions, A, B)                 A if conditions are True, B otherwise; temporal topological relation between if, then and else is equal.
  if(topologies, conditions, A)        A if conditions are True;              temporal topological relation between if and then is explicit specified by topologies.
  if(topologies, conditions, A, B)     A if conditions are True, B otherwise; temporal topological relation between if, then and else is explicit specified by topologies.
</pre></div>
The conditions are comparison expressions that are used to evaluate 
space time datasets. Specific values of temporal variables are 
compared by logical operators and evaluated for each map of the STDS.
<br>
<br>
The supported logical operators:
<div class="code"><pre>
Symbol  description

  ==    equal
  !=    not equal
  >     greater than
  >=    greater than or equal
  <     less than
  <=    less than or equal
  &&    and
  ||    or
</pre></div>

Temporal functions: <br>
<div class="code"><pre>

td(A)                   Returns a list of time intervals of STDS A

start_time()            Start time as HH::MM:SS
start_date()            Start date as yyyy-mm-DD
start_datetime()        Start datetime as yyyy-mm-DD HH:MM:SS
end_time()              End time as HH:MM:SS
end_date()              End date as yyyy-mm-DD
end_datetime()          End datetime as  yyyy-mm-DD HH:MM

start_doy()             Day of year (doy) from the start time [1 - 366]
start_dow()             Day of week (dow) from the start time [1 - 7], the start of the week is Monday == 1
start_year()            The year of the start time [0 - 9999]
start_month()           The month of the start time [1 - 12]
start_week()            Week of year of the start time [1 - 54]
start_day()             Day of month from the start time [1 - 31]
start_hour()            The hour of the start time [0 - 23]
start_minute()          The minute of the start time [0 - 59]
start_second()          The second of the start time [0 - 59]
end_doy()               Day of year (doy) from the end time [1 - 366]
end_dow()               Day of week (dow) from the end time [1 - 7], the start of the week is Monday == 1
end_year()              The year of the end time [0 - 9999]
end_month()             The month of the end time [1 - 12]
end_week()              Week of year of the end time [1 - 54]
end_day()               Day of month from the start time [1 - 31]
end_hour()              The hour of the end time [0 - 23]
end_minute()            The minute of the end time [0 - 59]
end_second()            The second of the end time [0 - 59]            
</pre></div>

Additionally the number of maps in intervals can be computed and 
used in conditional statements. <br>
The operator to count the number of maps 
is the hash <b>#</b>. 
<div class="code"><pre>
A{contains,#}B
</pre></div>
This expression computes the number of maps from space 
time dataset B which are during the time intervals of maps from 
space time dataset A.<br>
A list of integers (scalars) corresponding to the maps of A 
that contain maps from B will be returned. <br>
<br>

Furthermore the temporal algebra allows temporal buffering, shifting 
and snapping with the functions buff_t(), tshift() and tsnap()
respectively.
<div class="code"><pre>
buff_t(A, size)         Buffer STDS A with granule ("1 month" or 5)
tshift(A, size)         Shift STDS A with granule ("1 month" or 5)
tsnap(A)                Snap time instances and intervals of STDS A
</pre></div>

<h3>Temporal Operators</h3>
<p>
The temporal algebra defines temporal operators that can be combined 
later with spatial operators to perform spatio-temporal operations. 
The temporal operators process the time instances and intervals of temporal related maps. 
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
AND             &amp;       Intersection 
OR              |       Union
DISJOINT OR     +       Disjoint union
LEFT REFERENCE  =       Use the time stamp of the left space time dataset
</pre></div><p>
For example we can compute the intersection, union or disjoint union from time stamps of maps 
that temporally overlap, or we can just keep the time stamp of the left STDS.
</p>

<h3>Spatial vector operators</h3>

The module supports the following boolean vector operations: <br>
<div class="code"><pre>
 Boolean Name   Operator Meaning         Precedence   Correspondent function 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 AND            &        Intersection          1      (v.overlay operator=and) 
 OR             |        Union                 1      (v.overlay operator=or)  
 DISJOINT OR    +        Disjoint union        1      (v.patch)              
 XOR            ^        Symmetric difference  1      (v.overlay operator=xor) 
 NOT            ~        Complement            1      (v.overlay operator=not) 

</pre></div>

And vector functions:
<div class="code"><pre>
 buff_p(A, size)    	  Buffer the points of vector map layer A with size
 buff_l(A, size)    	  Buffer the lines of vector map layer A with size
 buff_a(A, size)    	  Buffer the areas of vector map layer A with size
</pre></div>
<br>

<p>
<h3>Combinations of temporal, vector and select operators</h3>

We combine the temporal topology relations, the temporal operators and 
the spatial/select operators to create spatio-temporal operators:

<div class="code"> <pre>
{"list of temporal relations", "temporal operator" "spatial or select operator"} 
</pre></div>

The spatial and the select operators can be used stand-alone. In this 
case the temporal topology relation "equal" and the temporal operator 
"left reference =" is assumed and used as default. This allows the 
convenient use of the spatial and select operators in case of space 
time vector datasets with equal time stamps.

<div class="code"> <pre>
 ---------------------------------------
|   |  &amp; |  | |  ^ |  ~ |  + |  : |  !: |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| &amp; | &amp;&amp; | &amp;| | &amp;^ | &amp;~ | &amp;+ | &amp;: | &amp;!: |
| | | |&amp; | || | |^ | |~ | |+ | |: | |!: |
| + | +&amp; | +| | +^ | +~ | ++ | +: | +!: |
| = | =&amp; | =| | =^ | =~ | =+ | =: | =!: |
 ---------------------------------------
</pre></div>

<h3>Examples: </h3>

Spatio-temporal intersect all maps from space time dataset A with all 
maps from space time dataset B which have equal time stamps and are 
temporary before Jan. 1. 2005 and store them in space time dataset D.

<div class="code"><pre>
D = if(start_date() < "2005-01-01", A & B)
</pre></div>

Buffer all vector points from space time vector dataset A and B with a distance of one and
intersect the results with overlapping, containing, during and equal temporal relations
to store the result in space time vector dataset D with intersected time stamps.
<div class="code"><pre>
D = buff_p(A, 1) {overlaps|overlapped|equal|during|contains,&&} buff_p(B, 1)
</pre></div>

Select all maps from space time dataset B which are during the temporal 
buffered space time dataset A with a map interval of three days, else
select maps from C and store them in space time dataset D.
<div class="code"><pre>
D = if(contain, td(buff_t(A, "1 days")) == 3, B, C)
</pre></div>
