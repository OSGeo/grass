# Find the native GEOS(Geometry Engine - Open Source) includes and libraries.
#
# This module defines:
#
# GEOS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find geos.h, etc.
# GEOS_LIBRARY, libraries to link against to use GEOS.  Currently there are
# two looked for, geos and geos_c libraries.
# GEOS_FOUND, True if found, false if one of the above are not found.
#
# For ossim, typically geos will be system installed which should be found;
# or found in the ossim 3rd party dependencies directory from a geos build
# and install.  If the latter it will rely on CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and
# CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH having the path to the party dependencies directory.
#
# NOTE:
# This script is specialized for ossim, e.g. looking in /usr/local/ossim.
