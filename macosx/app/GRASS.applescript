-- note: handler order on launch:
--   1-will finish launching (good place to check prefs; no nibs loaded yet)
--   2-launched (good place to show initial windows or dialogs)
--   2.5-open?
--   3-idle (waits for user action)
--
-- idle is supposed to be last, but open seems to cause it to think
-- it's not idle, so we can process drag-n-drop before idling.  No docs
-- say explicitly that this is the case, so speed of Mac and process load
-- could affect this.
